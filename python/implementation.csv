5004V000011UtbhQAC,Historical Trainer Comments,"abaqis Refresher for New Management: 11/21/18 - 2pm-4pm CT (Paula):  Pam Herman (Director of Clinical Operations) and Richard (Ricky) Turley (Assistant Administrator) where on the LOT today. Pam previously received abaqis training but needed a refresher so she can teach Ricky. Ricky has not used abaqis before. I verified he has a User set-up. Per Pam, Ricky will be the abaqis manager. Pam said they were most interested in knowing what they needed to do to achieve QAPI Accreditation. They have met 2 of the 4 standards so far. I reviewed what was needed to meet the other 2 standards: 5 RI, FI, SI, RO, CR in Q4 and 7 of the Facility Tasks (Sufficient Nursing and Inf Control tasks already completed, and 2 care area investigations completed). They were excited about the prospect of achieving Basic Accreditation by the end of Q4. I created a new sample for them per Pam's request and briefly reviewed the assessments. Pam said she is familiar with the assessments and the importance of comments. I demonstrated how to access the SBCA report and recommended they review it weekly. I demonstrated how to set-up Notifications and Scheduled Reports. A facility task snapshot and purposeful investigation snapshot was created per Pam's request. Pam said she is comfortable with generating a QAPI snapshot when they finish their sample. Pam and Ricky have access to the videos and plan to continue learning about abaqis through hands-on practice and watching the videos. No request for further LOTs at this time. 12/26 2pm CT abaqis Call scheduled with Ricky: following up the New Management Refresher Response to:  We have been doing the random interviews and facility tasks and that is going well, but I need to see if I can get some help in figuring out the next step and how to pull all the info together Completed training on f/u abaqis with Pam and Ricky- Monica- Reviewed how to edit current assessments. We adjusted some of the assessments before creating the new QAPI snapshot. Reviewed SBCA report. We locked the current sample and created the new snapshot. Reviewed unnecessary med; nutrition investigations including utilizing the CE pathway throughout the investigation. They had already completed 8 tasks with some identified areas in which they were already putting resolution in place. They are using the QAPI immediate action plan forms for a lot of their identified areas. They are extremely motivated to gain basic accreditation. We reviewed that again and reviewed where they can locate and print it off. They are in a rush to reach accreditation for this year; so they can go back to continuous abaqis usage. They both showed good understanding."

Reviewed the modules of Session 1 and how to begin. Mark asked if someone could be available after the 90-minute training to answer questions. I told him I am happy to be there at the beginning or at the end. I asked him to let me know when the training will be held. I also pointed out that he may want to schedule a Reports review and Q&A session a week after they go through the online training Session 1. Mark said he has plans to go through Session 1 again over the weekend and now realizes that he needs to get together with the DON to talk about the team since more people need to be involved than he first thought."

5004V000011Utc0QAC,Historical Trainer Comments,"Session 1 (8/7/20 - Kayla Harwell): Facility Assessment training completed. There were 9 staff members logged onto the training with an additional 4 call-ins. I'm not sure if these were additional staff or just the audio for the present staff. Everyone was on their own computers. These staff included: David (NHA), Evelyne (DON), Lorraine Krug (Dir of SS), Marianne Paterno (Medical Records), Reineen Dohman (unknown), Korie Rego (unknown - krego@job-haines.org), Nicole (unknown - smiller@job-haines.org), Carmen Pego (Admissions/Case management), and Devon Groce (ADON). I passed along Paula's apologies for not being able to conduct this training herself and let them know she had a family emergency. I asked Dave if he had done anything with the FA since he spoke with Paula. He said he went in there and did a few things, but it still needed worked on and other departments needed to do things. I showed Dave how to add additional participants to the workflow. I then took them to the task list and explained this is where they will go to work on the FA/edit it. I then walked through each section of the FA and explained how to complete it. Dave explained they had just done a hazards risk assessment and wanted to upload that to the FA. I showed him where to upload the documents and how to do it. I encouraged them to mark each section as complete after they have completed each of the sections and I showed them how to do this. I showed them the available resources within the FA, how to access the Resident population profile, as well as viewing the activity log. I showed them how to download and print the FA - from both the 'task' section and 'analyze' section. I explained the 'print for survey' button. There weren't any questions throughout the training, except a couple from Dave. No one else spoke. Dave said the training was very helpful. He wasn't feeling well when he spoke with Paula before so this was a good refresher and was also helpful since the layout of the FA has changed. I encouraged him to reach out to Paula if any questions arose."

5004V000011UtdbQAC,Historical Trainer Comments,"IS #1 03/31/20: Attendee - Sandra Miles, Director of Long-term care. Sandra informed me they have an active COVID19 resident just return from the hospital. They surveyors came to her facility last week and went through a questionnaire with her but not the COVID 19 survey (probable because it was before the survey was available). I showed Sandra the survey link in abaqis and emailed it to her directly. We started the training by reviewing the COVID19 Survey/self-assessment. I also provided the following abaqis training: 1. Assisted with duplicating her FA and adding COVID 19 to the All-Risk Hazard section; demonstrated how to print FA for internal and survey  2.

I showed them the accreditation report in abaqis and how to monitor which areas they are meeting. I then showed them the resources for accreditation on the website. April requested that I send those documents via email to her. They only had 1 hour for my training. April informed me of this about 20 minutes into the training, as she didn?t want me to explain things so much. There weren?t many questions throughout the webinar. April appreciated my time and appreciated me being so thorough. She thought it was very helpful. I provided everyone my contact information. April will be in touch if they need anything. Session 2 (3/4/20): Training completed with Gretchen. She's new to the corporate office, so she needed to become familiar with abaqis. She is the new Regional MDS. She said she had looked at abaqis a bit, but didn't do much. She initiially called into the webinar because she was having difficulties getting in. We continued to try to get in, but gave up after 15 minutes. She logged into abaqis and then I helped her navigate. I did a general overview of abaqis. We discussed the various functions/features of abaqis. I explained how Lutheran Homes utilized the program. She seemed interested in possibly getting the facilities to utilize PAC. I explained all the reports available in abaiqs without clicking into each of them. I then explained the corporate reports in detail. I also took her to the help and training resources link and explained the various tabs. I showed her where she could go to monitor the MDS uploads. She didn't have many questions throughout, but all questions answered. We discussed the training platform and she would like to get set up with that. I expressed that she could reach out at any time if she had any questions. She appreciated my time and explaining the program."

Today we went over new features including the dashboard, Covid 19 and concept of workflows and how to create them, work in them and analyze them. I also showed her where to find some of the newer reports and PIP's. Mary will get in and play around to see if she needs any more assistance. She felt pretty comfortable with how to find things now. She will start with core-q and ese and see how that goes. She will look around and see if she wants to start using the PIP's (she thought she would). She would like me to reach out every 2 months or sooner if there are changes she needs to be aware of. She will also reach out if she needs anything before then. "
5004V000011UtdfQAC,Historical Trainer Comments,"Session #1-TG-2/6/20 Attendees: Juan, Angela, Jaime and Sandy.

They would like the next session to be on snapshots. and they will work on the sample until then.We have scheduled that for 3/2/20 at 11 am eastern.  Session #2-TG-3/17/20-Attendees: Angela and Sandy. Today we discussed their progress with qapi assessments which is approximately 60% completed. We reviewed the three different types of snapshots. Angela did not want to create any type of snapshot today. She stated they are completely tied up with ensuring residents are cared for and they have all systems and protocols in place for Covid-19. She doubted if they could afford to have the staff carry on with doing qapi assessments. Her goal is to complete those, but feels that will be greatly slowed down d/t the activity that is occurring with the virus. We discussed our next steps. She stated I could check in the middle of April to see where things are with Covid-19 and how it is affecting their facility. I will set a task for the middle of April and check back in to see if they are at a point to move forward with more training or to assist with helping them create a snapshot.  "
5004V000011UtdgQAC,Historical Trainer Comments,"Session #1-TG-9/22/20 with Poppy-DON, Houbre-Compliance Officer and Madeline Rice-QA Nurse. We did a review of their FA and copying previous FA's into a new one. Answered some questions they had regarding the FA. We also reviewed the Customer Satisfaction Report and where the information came from on the RI/FI. They previously used Pinnacle and don't anymore. I sent Madeline the Core-Q information but they feel it is going to best to utilize our Customer Satisfaction Report for what they need. **Madeline and Houbre will need set up on all modules of the training platform.

5004V000011UtdhQAC,Historical Trainer Comments,"Session #1-TG with just Brandy. She stated nobody else would be joining because things were too busy. She was late to the call and I called the facility and she said she was going to join. I did a high level overview because it has been awhile since she has used abaqis. She stated she thought it would be best at the current time to get help with the MDS, be activated on the training platform and then in 3 weeks she would like me to reach out and see if she is ready to schedule a live webinar for the QAPI tools. She stated right now they are not at a point to do the survey readiness piece since the staff are so busy with Covid activity. She stated they would not be able to join any training sessions, so she can learn abaqis and then she would train them. I told her at any point they could be activated on the training platform if she thought that would be helpful. I will set a task to follow up with her. Please set Brandy Grindstaff on all modules of the training platform and notify her. "

5004V000011UtdoQAC,Historical Trainer Comments,"Session #1-3/19/20-TG-Michelle Brague and Tammy-DON. Today's session was to review some reports to answer questions they had from their original training. We reviewed SBCA, Ftag report, Customer Satisfaction. Michelle had some questions on the FA and adding info into it regarding Covid-19 that was discussed. She also inquired about ESE and Core-Q. After review she is not interested in Core-Q since they are not a member of AHCA and she would like to do ESE at some point, but right now they can't take it on, due to Covid-19. They will continue on with abaqis at this point and hope they have no active cases of Covid-19 in their home, if that should occur she stated they would probably back off of abaqis, except for keeping the FA and QAPI plan up to date with any changes. They cancelled the training for tomorrow and rescheduled for 4/7/20, if that changes she will let me know. I will set a task for a reminder.  Session #2-8/4/20-TG with Michelle and Tammy was just a review of their live site focusing on their FA and QAPI Plan. Michelle had asked that I review them and we did a quick go to meeting to go over some areas that were in need of updates. Examples: dates, changing staff who were listed and no longer there, areas that were left blank, like Adverse Events, addressing areas that had pre-populated text from the templates that they never made unique to their facility and reviewing with them again how to create a new FA and copying the old to get new MDS data in the Resident Population area. They will go in to update both. Michelle also mentioned that they have 3 dietary staff who traveled to Philadelphia which is a hot spot and returned to work and tested positive. They have test all staff and residents again and are awaiting results. Michelle stated it has been quite hectic because they tested everyone 2 weeks ago and again yesterday. She stated the paperwork and effort going into keeping residents and staff safe has been very time consuming. She stated abaqis utilization would remain on hold, with the exception of updating the QAPI Plan and FA. They will reach out if needed and I have a task set to check in on a routine basis."
5004V000011UtdOQAS,Historical Trainer Comments,"Session #1-TG-Misc. Reports with Carrie (DON). Carrie stated she will have a QA nurse starting in a couple of weeks that she will be co-sharing abaqis responsibilities with. Today we reviewed some misc. reports that Carrie hadn't used, including the customer satisfaction reports. She will take a look at those moving forward and identify some of those that she feels is beneficial. We may need to do some additional training once the new QA nurse gets onboard and gets her feet wet. Carrie stated things have been hectic with lack of staffing and their county is becoming a Covid hotspot. She stated things have been very slow........with abaqis. We decided to reconnect in September after the QA nurse starts and see how things are and determine if more training is needed."

MOUNTAIN VIEW: Rhandi Harris In this session I reviewed the QAPI cycle. Grace has not provided any direction (per Rick) about how often to conduct a QAPI Sample. (emailed Grace under prev IS series to request direction about this). I reviewed all the QAPI assessments and demonstrated how to access, how to add comments, how to finish later and how to save complete. Rick had a couple questions about the RI Visitor question. I told him her could ask the question and record the resident response, or he could add ""Before Covid"" to the question. He said they would discuss it as a team. At the end of the training I reviewed the QAPI cycle worksheet and provided an example, and showed them where the worksheet was located in Help and Training. I also emailed the worksheet to all attendees under the previous IS case.  "
5004V000011UtdqQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"1/15/20-TG-Session #1 with Kevin and department heads. He wanted an abaqis overview to allow everyone to see and then decide on what topics they would like to target with training. The DON seemed very skeptical of abaqis, what it was for and why they should use it. Kevin kept intervening to tell her how in the past when they have used abaqis the areas they have identified as concerns and how it lead them to a PIP. I started with features of abaqis, explained briefly customer satisfaction and PAC and focused more on survey readiness. Kevin wanted the team to understand how they can identify areas like surveyors. We wrapped up with a quick look at PIP's. Kevin scheduled a second session on the QAPI plan and a deeper dive into PIP's. During the call I anticipated that Kevin is getting some push back from the DON?? We will see as we progress with training. Session #2 will be on 1/30/20 at 1:30 pm on qapi plan and pip's. I will send the link. They are also not up to date on MDS upload. They currently have a consultant and are in the process of getting someone full time on board. We will re-visit this on the 30th. Once they are in place he would like them to have MDS upload training to get their files up to date. 1/30/20-TG Session #2 with Kevin and department heads. We covered PIP's, root cause analysis, QAPI plan. The DON was on the call and seemed more interested and on board today with the benefits of abaqis. They are still not up to date on MDS and discussed the role of MDS in abaqis. They are still trying to get someone full time on board and will get them trained when they can. Kevin stated they would not be using abaqis for survey readiness for the next 6 months. They do have current PIP's and the FA has been updated. He will get the QAPI plan updated as well and felt at this time this will be all that will be used in abaqis. They have had a big problem with staffing and felt it was contributing to using abaqis more. Kevin will get back with me on any further training that is needed for MDS training. 2/20/20-TG-Session #3 with Kevin, Carrie, MariAnn, Amy and Infection Control Nurse. We reviewed how to create a sample. Kevin wanted to hold off since the MDS were not up to date. Last files uploaded on 1/31/20. He will get that done and then create a sample. I will send the document and he will reach out if he has any problems. We discussed again the importance of the MDS uploads always being current in abaqis. We walked through a creation in the training site and discussed briefly the assessments. He just wanted a quick refresher since they were familiar with them. Kevin will get the MDS up to date, create a sample and start the assessments. He will get back with me on setting up another session to view their datea and the reports. I will set a task to follow up in a few weeks. "

5004V000011UtdRQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"3/12/19- TG-Session with Michael Coe. He will be the main abaqis user. Current census 18. Other staff that was previously trained on-site are still there, but he is not sure how much they will participate. He stated he has been directed to use abaqis as the primary person until a new person comes on board full time in May that will assist. He feels comfortable with the QAPI assessments and has already done some on paper and was familiar with those prior to his employment with Mountain View. We discussed plan for the cycle and her would like to do 1/3 of the census now and do four quarters a year. Next quarter he would like to increase to 50% because he will have help. He wants to get his feet wet first. He is very excited and appreciative of the help. He feels their is great benefit and didn't understand why they didn't use it before. A sample of 6/2 was created and he will complete by 4/2/18 for Session #2. We will go over snapshots, reports and investigations on next session. He wants to complete a full cycle by 6/1/19 and start new with Quarter 3.  4/5/19-TG-Session #2 with Michael Coe. He did a great job completing his assessments, including comments! The sample was locked and a QAPI snapshot was created. We discussed the different types of snapshots, CE pathway, investigations, root cause and the investigation reports. He is eager to learn and excited to get started on the investigations. We discussed facility tasks and he will decide if he will delegate some of those since the original three that were trained are still employed and aware of them. He didn't think Joy (Administrator) would do any, but if Shelly (DON) and Gwen (SS/Dietary) would have time to chip in or not. The new person has started and we discussed the training platform for her. I have asked him to send me her name so we can get her into the system as well. When he does I can have Cindy get her into the platform. He is still on task to complete by 6/1/19 and start a new cycle. Session 3 scheduled for 4/26/19 at 1 pm est and the link was sent to Michael.  4/26/19-TG-Session #3 No call No show for Session 3. Called facility and it went to his VM. Called back and talked to Administrator and she stated Michael was not in. She stated she would give him the message that the webinar was today and have him call me next week to re-schedule the webinar. 3/3/20-TG-Session #3 with Brooke DON and Gwen SS. Today we covered the FA and the QAPI Plan. Joy-Administrator was not on the call. Walked Brooke and Gwen through both. Brooke seemed to have an understanding of the two, but Gwen had a few questions about the purpose. I asked if Joy would be involved to help develop the two, Brooke and Gwen didn't feel she would and they would be doing both. Joy has not been involved with abaqis contribution from the beginning. Brooke felt the FA was a little overwhelming. We discussed the process of completion and I encouraged her to have Joy help with the development of it. We discussed the next training session and Brooke felt it would be best to wait a few weeks so she can work on the QAPI Plan and FA so she can apply what she learned today and get those finished up. Next session on 3/25/20 on the qapi sample. I encouraged Brooke to reach out if she has any questions as she starts the FA and the QAPI plan. "

5004V000011UtdSQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"SESSION 1:  Call with Rose and Joyce to discuss abaqis implememtation and how best I can support them. Rose and Joyce feel the homes are not conducting investigations correctly. The homes struggle with prioritizing care areas and residents, they struggle with identifying system issues and how to incorporate abaqis into their QAPI processes. We set the following plan to get all the homes on track: 1. I will be holding investigation live online trainings for the homes on the following dates: 8/6, 8/7, 8/8, 9/3, 9/4 and 9/5. The sessions will be open to all the homes. 2. I will be scheduling a call with each home's abaqis manager after the August sessions to review their SBCA, SBR and MDS 3.0 reports in order to assist them with selecting investigations.  3. Starting in August I will be holding a monthly call with Rose and Joyce to support them with their oversight activities. 4. Starting in August I will be holding a monthly Q&A session with all the homes.  Session 2:  Joyce and team in attendance. Created new random sample and reviewed QAPI assessments. They will spend 8 weeks conducting assessments. I will conduct another session for them to review reports in early October. Session 3 Mock Survey Workflow Training, In attendance: Stacy Harvey, Emily Connors, Stacey Piper. "

5004V000011UtduQAC,Corporate abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session1- Kjersti Beth was the only attendee. Reviewed how to create various samples, sample sizes and resident groups. Also reviewed and explained the different snapshot types and how to use the ah-hoc facility task features. Kjertsi would like to archive all samples under the filter drop down menu under the QAPI samples. Will check the box for client support feedback. "
5004V000011UtdUQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Training #1: 2/28/19 - abaqis Refresher with Administrators (2-3 pm CT)-All Administrators from the Texas homes were on the webinar. Joshua was not, he was out ill today. The basically wanted an overview/refresher of the features of abaqis, how to create a new sample, review of FA and QAPI plan and for the new Administrators what abaqis had to offer. I went over PAC/report, review of FA and QAPI plan, they all were familiar how to do a PIP, reviewed Corporate Reports, SBCA and MDS reports. We discussed accreditation and how to find it in abaqis. We also walked through creating a new sample, how to get started on the sample and how the reports connected to Investigations. We then reviewed the different snapshots and how to create one and walked through one investigation and how to get the report. A couple of Administrators felt they are comfortable with abaqis and didn't feel they needed any additional training, some felt it would be beneficial and others felt the biggest problem they have is finding the time to do it. We discussed choosing a smaller sample size to make it more manageable. They liked that idea so we walked through how to select the sample sizes. They all felt the training platform would be beneficial and thought that if I talked to Joshua we could come up with a plan that would help minimize the overwhelming feeling they had with their last samples. I don't know if he would be open to CSM or not. I left a message for him to set up a time to discuss going forward. The Administrators felt that some further education would be helpful. Training #2: 4/10/19 with Angie Merideth Administrator from the Richmond facility. She is new to the facility and was not on the call with the other Administrators on 2/28/19. Joshua White asked me to get her up to speed with a abaqis overview. Discussed the features of abaqis, how to create a sample, review of overview of assessments and reports, how those lead to an investigation and possibly PIP's. We reviewed the FA and QAPI Plan. I discussed with her the previous meeting and how Josh is getting together with them how to move forward with some training sessions. I also discussed the training platform with her and she thought they would be helpful. She discussed her concerns about awaiting annual survey any day now.She wanted to get her QAPI Plan and the FA done right away. She stated surveyors usually come the same time every year. She would like to hold off on a sample until after her survey is completed. She will also assess her team to see who  still knows what is abaqis is, how to use it etc. so she will know where to start. Once Josh gets back with me I shared with her that we will begin a series of training based on needs.   Training #3:  Training #4"
5004V000011UtdvQAC,Implementation Series 1,"Session #1-TG-12/16/19-Review of their incomplete FA that was done in Feb. 2019. Discussed importance of MDS upload to capture Resident Population Profile information correctly. MDS out of date again. He had the MDS nurse get everything up to date 11/19/19, but she has not uploaded since. I walked him through set up Notifications for the MDS upload report. He will make sure that is current. We discussed and reviewed the new abaqis dashboard and changes to the FA. I will send him the info, he will review and would like to walk through his completed FA in January after he returns from vacation. Session #2 set for 1/13/20 at 11 am.. They will be in survey window in February."
5004V000011UtdwQAC,Implementation Series 1,Session #1-TG-Attendee Mark Techmeyer-Administrator. Discuss how to do a qapi plan and FA. They have a FA dated 2019 that Cheryl Corporate Nurse created that Mark wants to use and he will ensure information updated along with Coronavirus info added. We shared his screen and he walked through getting a new one in with copied information brought over. He will get started on both. Next session scheduled for team for a abaqis overview. Link has already been sent. 
5004V000011UtdWQAS,Implementation Series 1 after rescinding a cancellation,"Session #1 with Wade Cies on FA and QAPI plan. Walked him through duplicating and revising their existing documents. He will get them up to date. He will determine if the data is accurate that has already been entered and clean them up as needed. He just got back from hospitalization and hasn't had a chance to get with the team to determine what needs they have related to training. We did view the MDS uploads and they were up to date now. He was not sure if Charles did it or if he actually trained the MDS nurse. He will follow up to see if MDS needs trained by us or if Charles took care of it. Wade also needs to finish updating users, removing old and giving out new. He will get back with me on training plans moving forward.  Session #2-TG-2/19/20 with Norm Administrator, Tracy Bourlet DON, and Reagan SS Director. Today was just an abaqis overview to identify where they would like to start with in abaqis. Norm was very positive about abaqis and thinks it is great and feels it would be greatly beneficial to the facility. They just had their annual survey and stated they did very well. Norm felt training would need to be on FA, QAPI Plan, PIP's and survey readiness. They did not need PAC training and were not interested in ESE or Core-Q at the current time. During the overview the DON felt some things were duplicative of things they can get now in other software like Matrix.  The DON stated she didn't see the benefit of abaqis. Norm intervened and tried to explain to her how they would glean important information and help with QAPI. She stated she was playing ""devils advocate"" and felt they didn't need a lot of the stuff in abaqis except FA and QAPI Plan. I tried to explain the benefits of abaqis, but again she wasn't sure they needed all those things and  wanted to know if they could only utilize certain features like FA and QAPI plan. I told them I would reach out to our Account Executives to check into for her. Norm then said he didn't think it was necessary and we could revisit things after our next training on FA and QAPI Plan. I am going to alert the AE, but have the AE speak to me about the account prior to them calling since this facility recently had cancelled and then rescinded it.  Norm didn't have his calendar with him and will email me dates when he would like to do the next training. I will alert AE and set a task to follow up with Norm on a date for the next training.  Session #3-TG-3/18/20 with Norm Administrator and Tracy Nourlet DON. Today was a training to cover the Facility Assessment. We discussed how to copy their current FA into a new and how MDS data will update. Tracy was talking on the phone during the training and kept apologizing. We got through most of the FA training and Tracy stated they needed to get off the phone to prepare for a call related to Covid-19. They stated on the call that although they needed the training and how to get a new FA created because Norm did not feel the previous one was filled out completely, they are not in survey window until the fall. They stated they are not at a pint to schedule any further training and we decided I would reach out middle April to see how things are with Coronavirus. They will reach out before then if needed. Tracy wasn't sure if they could work any of the FA at this time until they see how things play out with Covid-19. They have tested two residents in their facility, but they were negative. I will set a task to reach out in April. "
5004V000011UtdxQAC,Implementation Series 1,"Session #1-TG 1/16/20- QAPI assessment overview and key points on completing assessments, navigation, help section and brief overview of where the data goes on the SBCA Report. Prior to this session Rowena had the staff set up on the training platform. None were viewed. If time permitted they were also going to go ahead and start on the sample that we created on 12/18/19. Rowena stated they didn't have time. Today she wanted a brief overview of the assessments, how to log in, get to the sample and where the data went so they would have a basic understanding of the first step. She will give them an assignment and would like to work on the sample until 3/4/20 when we will do Session #2 and view reports and create a purposeful snapshot. I will set up a task to review the account in February and another to remind her of the next training. They were reminded of their access to the training platform for additional guidance if needed. Rowena will plan to look at the SBCA as they progress. They are expecting surveyors anytime since they are in their window. Attendees: Rowena, Bonnie, Tarsha and Jenna."

Linda was logged into abaqis during the call. Provided overview of abaqis and role of the abaqis manager. She stated she is part-time; hence, will be managing abaqis in addition to her MDS responsibilities. She is computer savvy. Created a new QAPI random sample (Spring/Summer 2019) with 10/27 residents. Linda identified the staff that will complete the assessments. Cleaned up abaqis dashboard by archiving snapshots and facility ad hoc tasks. Discussed user management and keeping users current.

We reviewed the changes to the new dashboard, navigation, created a Sample and overview of getting started with the QAPI assessments. Kim will get her staff started and Brandi will help oversee. Kim wanted a smaller sample size and wants to work on the sample and investigations until the end of June and a new sample will be done on July 1st. She will try and do a full sample next time once everyone gets refreshed on abaqis. Next session scheduled for 3/12/20 at 1pm to review their data and qapi reports. I will send link and the abaqis manager checklist for Brandi. I will also set a task to check progress prior to next session. "

Provided a high level, 60 minute overview and also touched on Core-Q per Aysha's request. They had this workflow activated by Aysha did not understand how to access it after she set up the workflow. The workflow was not showing up because the start date was set in the future. I turned the controls over to Aysha and walked her through changing the start date and assigning staff to complete the interviews. They have not uploaded MDS files since March so no recent discharge residents were showing up. After the training Aysha said she had planned to cancel abaqis but is now reconsidering. Add'l training set up for Aug 25th."

It was determined his staff has been trained on the snapshot and investigations, but he hasn't. I answered his questions and set up a investigations training with him for 1/31/20 at 3 pm est. Link was sent. He is not sure if he will end up doing Core-Q or not. He wants to gather more information about it and then decide if it will be beneficial for them or not. They currently use ours and doesn't have any problem with it and is not sure if he needs to do both. Session #2-TG-1/31/20- investigation overview with Darrin along with investigation reports. He wanted how the SBCA report linked to the investigations and then after investigations where the data went, so covered investigation reports. We also discussed if he wanted to activate Core Q, he stated he does but not right now. Maybe in the next 6 weeks or so. He stated they fell off of doing abaqis in 2019 and wants to get the team back in a routine. We also talked about the training platform and he would like to have all modules so he can jump in a refresh himself when he is thinking of something specific. He also would like some of his staff to also have access. He will send me a list of their names. We discussed the Client Needs Review and he will send me some dates he has available and get that set up in the next month. "

5004V000011Ute2QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"5/28/20-TG-with Tanya and Abbie to go over the FA. Started the training and about half way in Tanya stated that Gail-Administrator already does this on paper. She stated that Gail manually gathers the information and has created one that she gives to the surveyors upon entrance. Tanya stated that she didn't want to do two and she knew that Gail would not do it  in abaqis and that one of the nurses would have to do it for her. She stated before we went any further she wanted to discuss with Gail on whether or not she would want it in abaqis or not. I reviewed with her the benefits of having it in abaqis, MDS loading the resident population profile data for them and having it housed to keep it updated without having to do it manually. She wasn't sure and wanted to talk to Gail about it. She stated she had done the QAPI Plan in abaqis before 2018, but never updated it in abaqis. Next week our training will be a refresher. We already have that set up. She will update me next week on the FA and if needed I will repeat the FA training and encouraged her that Gail could attend the sessions. She stated Gail probably wouldn't and I got the sense that Gail is not computer savvy.  6/4/20-TG with Tanya and Abbie to do a refresher on QAPI Plan and PIP's. Tanya has done the QAPI plan in their live site, but been awhile since she has looked at the PIP's section. We walked through the steps to build both of them. She stated she talked to the Administrator and at this time they will not be using abaqis for the FA. Again I went over the benefits, but she stated the Administrator wants to continue her own process. We already have our next session scheduled same day and time next week. Tanya already has the link and a task is set for a reminder."

She will notify her LNHA, who will then forward  the request to their IT department. She will not be able to lock the current sample nor create their new sample until she has the appropriate level of access. In the meantime she has already cleaned up the resident list which now matches their current census of 52. I reviewed again the process for locking and creating samples. Also demonstrated the associated help document.  Demonstrated how to verify  which MDS assessments have been uploaded in to the software.  She voiced that she along with her DON have decided to use our 4week/8week module for assessments and investigations. She conveyed that the facility staff do not like abaqis, but says that she loves it. Discussed that she will need to be an abaqis champion and will need to provide much needed encouragement.     Not sure if she still needs MDS upload assistance at this point. Apparently she and her DON (who also does MDS's) cleaned up the resident list in the past few days. She did have questions about assessments without matching MDS data. Might be good to reach out to answer any relevant MDS upload questions.      "
5004V000011Ute4QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 - Had a lengthy phone conversation with Grace on 4/29/19. She wanted me to walk through every step with her, with managing residents, creating sample, and printing the assessments list. She first wanted to create their sample. I walked through that with her. She knew where to go and how to create it. We discussed the sample sizes. She decided on 25 for census and 5 for admission. She thought she had to lock the sample after she created it. I educated her that you lock it after all of the assessments have been completed. When she reviewed the residents in the sample, she said that there were multiple residents that had discharged and were still showing as active. MDS uploads were up to date. I explained that it's likely the DC MDS hadn't been uploaded yet, but then showed her how to manually discharge residents. I took her to the resident list. I walked her through how to go in and edit the resident's stay. She couldn't remember the discharged dates, so she wrote down all of the resident names and then called someone to get the discharge dates. She then thought she had to create her QAPI snapshot. I educated her that the snapshot is created after the assessments are completed, so that snapshot incorporates all the responses coded on the assessments.  While he was looking up the discharge dates, I showed her how to get to the assessments to complete them. While I was doing that, she received the discharge dates. We then navigated back to the resident list and she started inputting the d/c dates. As she doing that, I heard a couple of the discharge dates, which were all for the month of April. I explained again that they needed to make sure DC MDS were being uploaded. She thought they may have a delay in completing their MDS - she would look into that. I then navigated her to the QAPI sample under the manage tab so she could see how discharging residents translated into the sample. I showed her how she could see the residents that got replaced and by whom. We then navigated to the assessments and showed her that was where they went to complete assessments. She wanted to know how to print it for assignments. I showed her the 'save and print' option and she printed the residents/assessments. We discussed how long they wanted to spend doing assessments/investigations. She wanted to give the staff 3 weeks to do assessments - so she wanted them done by May 21st. Then the remaining time would be spent on investigations. She asked if abaqis sent any reminders that a deadline was approaching - her staff were requesting that so that they knew they needed to get their assessments done. She said she always emails them with the deadline initially, but they forget. I explained that abaqis doesn't do that, but that I could send them emails with reminders. She said she would set up calendar invites for the staff with reminders and then she wanted me to email her with the reminders, to remind her. I will plan to do that. She did express that her staff were kind of 'lost' with what to do. She wasn't sure if her staff were actually doing the assessments or investigations - she worried that they were just marking everything postive. I offered to complete a webinar or two with the staff so we could regroup, provide additional training, and answer any questions that they had. She said she would offer that to her staff. All of Grace's questions were answered. She was very appreciative of my time. I let her know that she can always call or email me at any time, which she always does when she needs something. As I've mentioned in previous notes, Grace is a challenge to work with, but we do have a good relationship. She needs things broken down and simplified for her to understand. Session 2 (8/19/19) - Had a 40 minute phone conversation with Grace on 8/19/19. She said their compliance officer was at the building towards the end of July and she received her report and wanted my assistance. She asked about the Casper report and whether that could be integrated into abaqis. Explained that it couldn't, but the Casper report could be used to identify areas for PIPs. She asked whether they needed to have an action plan if there was no Ftag identified, as the compliance officer said they needed to have corrective action. We discussed the Investigations reports - specifically the Ftag one. She had not run these. When we ran the report, they had 7 Ftags identified and Grace did not know about them. We discussed options for corrective action. I showed her the QAPI Immediate Action Plan. Explained using the Immediate Action Plan vs PIPs. I showed her how the print the Ftag investigation report. Showed her how to print other quarters as well. She wanted to give these to the compliance officer. She had a couple other questions and all questions were answered. She was going to work on her response to the compliance officer and she wanted to run it by me. She would give me a call later in the week. Session 3 (9/22/20): Training completed with Anthony Pham (new NHA). Jo Ann, the DON was supposed to be on the training, but she had to take a call with the ombudsman. I am not sure if she showed up for the training or not, but I don't believe she did. Anthony was not familiar with abaqis, aside from the little bit Greg explained to him. We did an abaqis overview. I started out by explaining the dashboard/landing page and went into navigation. While going through navigation, I explained the various functions of the program - survey readiness (samples/investigations), PAC, QAPI tools, customer satisfaction, reports, etc. After explaining the different functions, I then went back and showed him the functions and how they worked. I showed him what the sample/assessments looked like. Showed him the snapshot and the PAC assessments. I went through the PIP example so he could see what our template was like. I showed him the QAPI plan and then took him to the reports. I briefly showed him a few reports in this section (SBCA, PAC, customer satisfaction) and explained the other reports. I then went through the help and training resources link and explained cycles. I showed him the meeting minutes section. There were no questions throughout. Anthony said it was pretty self-explanatory. He said he would play around with it and would let me know if he had any questions. He said he knew they were deficient in some areas and needed to start working on things to improve. He thought they may start a sample in October. He appreciated my time and thought the training was helpful."

Ann-Maire prefers to send me a Skype invite for her trainings so this training was conducted via Skype business. I assisted her with generating a new sample and checking the resident list for accuracy. She wanted to do the sample before the end of Q1 so a smaller sample of 10/3 was selected. She said they had their survey last week and did well but are waiting for the 2567, which should be delivered by 4/1.  IS#2 1/21/20: Attendees - Ann-Marie West (Admin), Becca Wald (QA Nurse), Marlyce Cozart (MDS Nurse). Ann-Marie prefers skype so this training took place on skype per Ann-Marie's preference. They have not been active in abaqis for nearly a year. Verified MDS files up to date and reviewed the new dashboard. Provided instruction on deleting and adding Users, Creating a Sample, and closing and creating a Facility Assessment. Reviewed the sections of the Facility Assessment and provided guidance for adding participants. Ann-Marie requested we meet again in 2 weeks and said she will send me a skype invite. "

I will set a task to follow up with Bryan to see if he has anymore training needs. "
5004V000011Ute8QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 1/28/20: Attendees - Belinda Ru,ssell, QA Nurse; Nicole Russell, QA Nurse; Shelby Reynolds (Administrative Assistant/Med Records). They had not been active in abaqis for 3 quarters. Recently they uploaded all their MDS files but their Resident list still showed discharged residents. Assisted them in adding Users, cleaning up Resident list, and generating the QAPI Sample. They would like to do a rolling sample in order to capture all residents prior to their CP meeting. They have CP meetings once a week and cover 6 residents. Shelby will be responsible for making the QAPI Assessment assignments. I provided suggestions for making assignments, e.g., choose residents at least 2 weeks prior to CP meeting; print the QAPI Sample every Monday morning and highlight the Residents to be completed that week; Put the initials of the staff responsible to complete the QAPI assessment next to the corresponding open circle on the print out; Ensure the QAPI Assessments are completed prior to their scheduled CP meeting. Will f/u in 2 weeks to cover Reports and PIPs. IS# 2 2/1120: Attendees -  Belinda Russell, QA Nurse, and Shelby Reynolds, Administrative Assistant. We started the session by discussing what worked and what didn't over the last couple of weeks. Belinda expressed frustration with the MDS staff because they have not been providing a list of residents with upcoming Care Plan meetings. They are choosing their residents in the sample based on who is coming up for care plan. Belinda said she talked with the Administrator and expects the problem will be fixed. Shelby is making the assignments and said she is getting a lot of push back from staff about completing the assessments. Shelby said they do not see the value in doing the QAPI assessments and they say they don't have time. We reviewed the QAPI Assessment Reports and I encouraged them to share the reports with the staff as a way to promote buy-in. Belinda felt the reports would be a good thing to bring to the monthly QA meeting. Next, we reviewed the PIP template using an example from the RI report about Food Quality. I showed them how to use the quality score as their Baseline Measurement. I explained the importance of Root Cause Analyses and gave an example using the 5 Whys. Belinda said they were in their survey window and wanted to make sure their QAPI Plan was up to snuff. I reviewed their plan and suggested they add their QA team (no names or titles were listed). I showed them how to save it as formal and mark it when printing it for survey. They asked for another webinar in a couple weeks to review their progress. Next webinar is scheduled for March 3rd at 11 AM CST. "

This webinar was to help them restart abaqis and introduce them to QAPI tools they had not been using. Started by reviewing the Corporate QAPI Plan and then generated a Facility Level Plan. With Betty's permission and input I assisted them with adding QA team members and other notes to their plan. Next we looked briefly at the FA with was completed primarily by Melody. I reminded the to duplicate the plan annually, on or before the create date. Next due date is January 2020. They are currently doing PIPs on paper but I encouraged them to consider putting their PIPs in abaqis. Next I assisted them with generating a current sample and then reviewed the QAPI Reports. Betty said the have all the same staff so the did not need training on completing the QAPI Assessments since they have completed them in the past. Finally, I reviewed the Readmission Report and talked about how this report can be used in their QA meetings. Throughout the webinar I talked about the upcoming regulations and interjected how abaqis can help them to show evidence of compliance (where relevant).

5004V000011UteCQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (10/2/19): Completed training with Crislyn while we completed the Needs Review. This training was completed by me walking her though click by click. I took her to the Help and Training resources link to show here where Client Support's contact information was. While she was in there, she asked me about the various Help Documents that were there. She ended up printing: Getting Started w/Random Sample; Why Use Samples; Tips for Managing Residents; Starting QAPI Assessments; Generating QAPI Reports. I walked her though how to create a sample. We discussed the sample sizes. She decided on 30 C and 5 A. She put the end date for Nov 1st and was thinking maybe they could do 1 resident a day. After creating the sample and looking through it, she was excited that most everyone was still in the building. She said there were two that had discharged. I walked her through the steps of discharging residents. I then showed her how to find who the residents were replaced with. Both replacement residents were still in the building. I then showed her how to get started with the assessments and complete them. We then scheduled 3 additonal trainings. We'll discuss reports on 10/16/19 at 11am CT. We'll discuss Investigations on 11/6/19 at 11am. We'll discuss PIPs on 11/20/19 at 11am CT. More trainings will likely occur after this, but this is what we scheduled for now. *Not sure an evaluation needs to go out for this training. Session 2 (10/16/19): Training completed with Crislyn. We got started 25 minutes late. I called Crisyln at 10 minutes after 11am ET and the woman who answered couldn't get ahold of her. I then followed up with an email and she arrived to the webinar 10 minutes later. She said she was on a call. It sounded like she had trouble logging into the webinar as well. We discussed the SBCA, MDS 3.0, MDS Indicator Rates, and Summary by Resident. She didn't think a couple of the MDS items were correct. I instructed her to speak with MDS to see if there was a coding error. While reviewing the MDS Indicator Rates Report, she asked which MDS the information came from, and I told her I would find that information out. She didn't like that when you clicked on the resident's name, it didn't tell her which MDS it came from. That was all she wanted to cover for training - she said it was plenty. All questions answered.  Session 3 (11/8/19): Training completed with Crislyn, Bernice (SSD), and Angie (Activities). I informed Crislyn that PCC and abaqis were now integrated. She was very excited for that and thought that would make things much easier. We discussed their sample. They had not completed all assessments for everyone.Crislyn and the others were talking and she thought they would start a new sample for November. I gave them another option and discussed cycles. Crislyn didn't appreciate me not telling her what to do. She didn't like that I give them options. She said she doesn't do well when things are left up to her and she wants to be told what to do because she doesn't know the program. She said once she knew the program and how everything worked, then she could make more decisions on her own. We determined that we would lock the current sample and use what data they have. They would then spend November and some of December, if needed, doing investigations. Then they would finish the year doing PIPs/corrective action. They would then start a new sample/cycle at the beginning of the year. I showed them how to lock their sample and Crislyn locked it for them. When we do trainings, Crislyn likes to have my screen up as well as her own, so she can click around like I am. We then reviewed the SBCA and I explained how to use that to determine who to investigate. Some areas didn't have comments, so they learned which questions needed comments (as some don't seem like you would). As we were reviewing the SBCA, some questions came up from Bernice about CR and the weights. There was also questions about the AR, as a resident was coded for hospitalizations and death and they didn't know which admission to use. I showed them the yellow banner with the date and that was the date of the admission they should use. Also while reviewing the SBCA, Crislyn gave some great feedback to the other two. She seems to really understand the purpose/intent of the questions and what needs done. We then moved on and created their QAPI snapshot. We discussed the differences between the snapshots. I went over how to navigate the snapshot and we discussed the Un Med investigation/pathway. They had had enough at this point, so we finished the training. Bernice said things made much more sense now and they knew more than they did last year. All questions answered. Crislyn still wanted to have training on 11/20/19. Session 4 (9/16/20): Training completed with Erika and Jonathan. Jonathan is their intern/administrator in training that will be overseeing abaqis. Jonathan did not have a login, so I showed Erika how to get him setup as a user and discussed the access levels. I then started going over navigation of the main dashboard. I went into the resident list and explained how the list was managed. I also explained resident groups and that they would go to the random QAPI samples to create a sample. I explained how workflows worked. Erika wanted to see the COVID self assessment, so I showed that to her - explaining the mange, tasks, and analyze sections. Erika then asked about PIPs. I walked through the example and then walked through how to create one. I then went and explained all the various features that abaqis offers and how they work. I went into the reports section and showed them all the reports that could be ran. I explained the PAC reports and that they could still get some information from the reports based on MDS information, without completing the assessments. Explained they get more detailed information if they complete the assessments. I then finished up by discussing the help and training resources link. We went over the various tabs. I showed them a few of the implementation documents and explained cycles. When I finished, Jonathan said Erika had to step out. Jonathan asked about the readmission rate and how they knew what to compare that percentage to (to know if it was high or was good). I encouraged him to reference their QM. Jonathan asked for my contact information and I provided him with the abaqis trainers email. I told him that I would be going out on maternity leave soon and that email would ensure his email got to the right person - myself or Danielle. He said he would pass on the information to Erika. All questions answered. Jonathan expressed that he thought abaqis seemed pretty self explanatory."

We discussed the QAPI reports difference between SBCA and individual reports. The next session she would like to cover the QAPI Plan and PIP's. If time allows we will do the FA, but if not she said she will hold off on FA. She wants to get the homes to start getting them back into abaqis.

Erica is very engaged with abaqis, ask lots of question, and is very excited to implement it more into the facility. Erica is concerned that due to increase Covid testing requirements, this may inhibit abaqis progress. She stated, their since thier area is over 10% they now have to test all residents 2 times a week.

Call today with Cindy Stein. Says she has retired, but is temporarily working on a consulting basis until they hire her replacement near the 4th quarter of this year. Reports things have been real crazy lately with COVID and is in need of a refresher training session for the homes next week. Will send dates and time as they are west coast facilities. Cindy also stated that one of the homes, Los Altos will need their own separate training sessions to get them up and running. Will develop a draft training plan for them and send to Cindy Stein. She also has some other RDCO's who are not familiar with abaqis and one who is not too savvy, but would like some training with them to familiarize themselves with the software and their processes. They use the 6 month cycles. They have CSM with a sample that includes  10 percent of their ADC. Then the RDCO's Create the snapshots for themselves via a mock prior to survey window opening and also one snapshot for the facility to self assess themselves. They snapshot looks back and pulls in 4 months worth of the assessments. The homes review the reports using the SBR report each morning during stand-up meeting  to address ""real time"" any concerns they have . Doesn't want homes to be overwhelmed with abaqis to the point where they say ""Oh, we have to do abaqis again"".  They have been through that before with previous cycles, quarterly, tri-annual etc....They are using abaqis very differently from the way we train, but this method works for them and keeps their staff in tune with abaqis. Wll develop a draft training plan to send to Cindy and hope to have it finalized before August  20th  as she would like to present it to their operations team at their regional meeting. 10:30 AM 40 min Initial Meeting with Cindy Stein ID: 737-506-613 Attendee List Diagnostics Name Email Address Join & Leave Times Sebrena Easley Sweeney ssweeney@providigm.com 10:30 AM - 11:09 AM +19493573821   10:33 AM - 11:09 AM ***SESSION 2- S.Sweeney  8/07/2020 Abaqis Overview with Cindy Stein and Corporate Team (Meet and greet the team as this was previously Patrick Campbell's Customer).  Abaqis Overview training session conducted  today with Cindy Stein and members of  who will be taking over as she officially retires later this year.

I followed the PPT. I then went over basic navigation (notifications, manage tab, reports, etc). Discussed the help and training resources and pointed out a few of the implementation resources. We then discussed the QAPI Sample and created their sample for them. They wanted 15 Census and 5 Admission. We then discussed the RI, FI, and RO assessments. I emphasized the importance of comments. We finished the session by reviewing the MDS Report and SBCA. We discussed their homework to complete prior to Session 2. There were a pretty engaged and active group as they asked many questions throughout and Derek made some great comments throughout. He expressed how important the comments were in regards to survey. If they wanted to prove they were unaware of a problem with a resident, they could pull up the interview to show the surveyor. All questions were answered. We scheduled their Session 2 webinar for June 20th at 10am CST. Derek expressed that he's excited to start using abaqis. Prior Session 2:  We had all staff members that were a part of Session 1. The had only completed 3 RIs and a couple FIs. Derek said he was very concerned because something triggered abuse/neglect and didn't know why. He said they were in his notifications. Derek indicated he had not run any of the reports. I followed the PPT. When we got into abaqis we looked at the notifications. There were a few residents that triggered for abuse based on keywords. I opened up the first notification and read through the comments. I could not figure out why abuse triggered based on what I read. I explained to them, that it could have triggered based on 1 word that was made in a comment. Explained the keyword notification for abuse vs actual abuse triggering. I looked at this once again after training and it appears it flagged based on the word ""staffing"". We then discussed the SI, CR, and AR. We then discussed the SBCA report and the MDS report. We then discussed the PAC assessments. We discussed the PAC reports. We then discussed the different snapshot options and created their Purposeful Investigation and Facility Task snapshots. I showed them how to navigate the snapshot and add residents. We then discussed how to complete investigations using CE Pathways and Guidance to Surveyors. I showed them the help and training resources link and showed them where all of the pathways/forms are. They felt comfortable with the investigations and didn't really have any questions. Derek said he really liked the investigations and having that as a resource. He said sometimes he didn't fully understand why they received a citation. He thought that would be very helpful. We discussed their homework to work on prior to Session 3. We discussed scheduling their Session 3. He said they would meet and talk about it. They just had a complaint survey and received 7 tags (no harm) so they were working on their POC. The POC had to be submitted by next Friday, so he would reach out after that to schedule Session 3. All questions answered.  RESTARTING  "

We looked at their current snapshot and discussed how those care areas triggered. We discussed the nine mandatory tasks and did a brief overview. We discussed were the corporation was in the CSM cycle on how they can still benefit from doing investigations and corrective action before the new sample begins in January 2020. Tony would like to talk to the group. He will check users and with the MDS nurse to see if any training is needed there. He will decide if he would like live training on investigations, but was interested in being set up on the training platform for himself for right now.  Holly Carner from Medline was on the call and the DON Amber.

5004V000011UteWQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (11/21/19): Training completed with Patti (DON). We discussed the FA. We discussed the duplicate button and what it did. She was confused why nothing showed up when she did that. She said she had written a long paragraph and it wasn't on the one she created. We looked through the FA's she had and figured out she duplicated the wrong one - she should have duplicated ""survey 2019"". We then discussed the FA and the different sections. She said she didn't understand the other sections before and had not completed them. She said she would work on it and if she had any questions she would let me know. She said their survey window opens in January and wants to make sure they are survey ready. She indicated they don't really use abaqis because she ""has thousands of other things to do"".  I will plan to reach out in a couple weeks to check and in and schedule a Needs Review. Session 2 (9/4/20):  Called Patti at our scheduled time of 1pm ET today. When I called, Jen Tiffany picked up and said Patti was on the phone with CS. They locked themselves out of abaqis and couldn't get in. They were then successful with logging in and we got started. Patti said they hadn't had any time to do anything with abaiqs because of COVID, but wanted to make sure she knew how to do the FA, as she needed to get it updated and it was very important. She said it was perfect timing when I called earlier this week. Patti said there was a lot to update with the FA to include how COVID affected them, etc. This was a training session on the FA, but not done via webinar. I explained where to click and they navigated in their site. Patti wanted to look at their most recent FA so I took them to the analyze section so she could view it. I explained that their FA was created in Nov 2019, so soon their MDS information will be outdated and I suggested they create a new FA and duplicate it. Patti agreed. I took her to the manage section and showed her how to create/duplicate the FA. I then explained the different areas of tasks, manage, and analyze and what she could do in each of them. I showed them how to edit the FA in the task section. I pointed out the 'mark as complete' button on each section. I then showed them how to view/print the FA. Patti wanted to print last years to have as a reference when she made the updates. They had a lot of 'active' FAs. I suggested they close the old ones. Patti agreed. I showed them how to do that and they did it on the call. Patti thought her screen looked much better after they did that. Patti took notes during our call so she knew how to do everything. She said she would be working on the FA this weekend. Jen then asked how to reset Patti's password, so I showed her how to do that. Patti appreciated the assistance. I encouraged her to reach out if she needed anything."

5004V000011Utf6QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 2,"09/25/20- DH- Training conducted with facility staff including Susan Huynh, Jackie Tafoya-Espinoza, Maria Soto, Lori Gutierrez, Redaet Mersha, Lisa Haunand, Paulena, Lydia Condoner, and Herlynn Figuerres. This training only lasted about 50 minutes. Usually staff are more interactive and asking lots questions, with small talk at beginning of meeting. When attempting to as Susan about her week, she was very short and direct, which is out of the norm. Staff did not ask questions pretty much the entire meeting, and when explained the MDS 3.0 and SBCA report I asked if that seemed something they could utilize, they stated, Maybe. Shun usually attends, not sure if she came in, but was not in initally. Last meet, Shun did say she did not see the benifit of the service. I did go into detail then about the benifits of abaqis, survey readiness, and QAPI tools, and she agreed abaqis would helpful. We reviewed Staff Interview, Census and Admission Record reviews, MDS 3.0 and SBCA, and expectations moving forward. . I asked mulitple times if they had any questions, they just stated no.  "
5004V000011Utf8QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,Session 1 with Emily. They don't have their logins or passwords so Emily will be following up with Carmen to get that done. I did walk them through their live site and created their Cycle 2 random sample. They will conduct abaqis twice per year 2 months QAPI assessments 4 months investigations and corrective action. Their current census is 107 which are primarily long term stay residents. We choose a 30/30 sample. They will have until August 31st to complete the assessments. They have tablets and laptops and dedicated staff to conduct abaqis activities. The staff are all familiar with abaqis due to using abaqis in the past.  Session 2 with Emily. Reviewed QAPI reports. I will send an email to schedule investigation training in 2 weeks.  Session 3 with Emily. Created snapshot reviewed SBCA and MDS 3.0 reports. We reviewed each care area and discussed how to investigate and resident selection.

She is also the Performance Improvement Coordinator as well as the Infection Control Prevention.  Conveys that the previous abaqis manager has departed and she has been assigned this role, but is only familiar with the QAPI Assessments.  Reviewed the QAPI Reports today and reminded her that her teams needs to enter comments for negative findings.  4/29/2020 Session 2 --Abaqis Manager Training Conducted abaqis Manager training session today with Elizabeth K Davis.  Reviewed All features under the Implementation tab.  Reviewed 8 steps in the abaqis Implementation handbook.  Q&A Session scheduled for next week.  Will check to see if they would like to use the PAC features.  High level review of all abaqis features to be reviewed next week.  "
5004V000011UtfAQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 - Training completed on 6/13/19 with Maggie and Ren (Karen Milroy). Ren provided me with additional information about how abaqis has been used in their facility. She said that ever since they started using abaqis in September 2014, they have completed asessments along with their MDS schedule. When a resident has an MDS due, that is when they complete that resident's assessments. She said that different staff members completed different assessments. Ren is the one that does the RI and FI. Ren did not believe that anybody looked at the information that was gathered. She thought they just gathered the data and nothing was done with it. Maggie thought that Bonnie (NHA) received a report from us and that was shared with her. Ren expressed that they used to have a ""hands off"" DON, and now that Maggie is here, who is very hands on, she's hoping things will change. We discussed QA Cycles and creating a sample if they wanted to. I expressed that the way they did it wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but something needed to happen with the information they gathered. I showed them the SBCA and MDS reports and showed them that there were many other reports to run. I showed them how to run them based on date range since they don't have a sample. We discussed the different snapshot types and I created a snapshot for their current data. We then discussed the investigations and how to complete them with CE Pathways. Discussed facility tasks. They said they would be coming into their survey window next month. I emphasized the importance of completing the facility tasks and medication review. I also discussed the PIPs and what that looked like in abaqis. They were very interactive throughout training and asked a lot of great questions. They both really liked the program and definitely saw the benefit of it. Maggie was surprised this was the first she had heard about it since she's been in LTC for 17 years. She really liked the reports we had and expressed they were better than PCC. She did think it would take a lot of time though, which was a concern. They thought they needed one person, like a QA person, to take on abaqis. They get pulled in many different directions so it may be difficult. All questions answered. I will continue to follow up and see if additional training is needed."
5004V000011UtfBQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session #1 Loretta McFee DON, Morgan Burton ADM and IDT team in attendance. Reviewed navigation and GS implementation plan. Reviewed QAPI snapshot.

5004V000011UtfGQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"3/7/19 2pm-4pm MT (Paula) Goal: Conduct an initial overview and adapt to include Investigations training with two facilities who completed their samples right before an ownership change this quarter, They are ready to investigate their newly created snapshots. They used to be on CSM and quarterly. Since they are two facilities now they will need to create their own samples and snapshots. Attendees:Mona Reyes, Quality Assurance Specialist; Pam Thorton, Regional Nurse; Jill Mathews, Interim MDS (previously Regional Nurse);  Linda Bullock, Administrative Director of Sombrillo; David Lamb, Administrator of Sierra; Elise Belcher, IDON; James Kershner, Central Supply/ Scheduler; Marcos Erives,    BOM; Stella Garcia, Dietary Director; Isaac Romero, Maintenance Directorl; Melissa Harrison, Records Director; Nakiva Mirabal, Activities Director; Melissa Harrison, Records Director. Provided an overview with focus on Investigations.

Will notify client support."
5004V000011UtfjQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 : 30 minute phone conversation with Janice Bridges today, 6/4/19. She called me and had multiple questions. She said they struggled to get past a certain point and she wasn't sure where to begin with her questions. She said they can get the interviews/assessments done and can create the snapshot, but they struggle with the snapshot. They struggle to get everything done within the timeframe that they need to. They get some done, but cant get to all of them as it's a lot. It's a lot to do to actually go through the investigations. She said they were currently trying to do abaqis quarterly. She wanted to do it quarterly so everyone would get used to abaqis and wouldn't forget how to do it. She said they've been getting better and better. We did discuss slowing things down a bit and doing cycles less frequently so they would have more time to spend completing the investigations. She thought that would likely be a good idea, that way they could focus more. We talked about breaking down their cycles and spending X amount of weeks for assessments and X amount of weeks doing investigations. She said it was hard for her to breakdown like that because it depended on the residents that were chosen. Sometimes they could do assessments more quickly than other times because of the residents. We discussed the investiations and pathways, as she had a few questions with those; specifically accidents. She thought they were making things more difficult than they needed to be. It did kinda seem that way. The accident pathway confused her because theres so many categories that fit under accidents and she was just looking into falls. She said she got questions from other staff members frequently, so she wanted to make sure that she was doing things correctly. I asked if it would be beneficial to get some training scheduled with all the staff members, so we could make sure everyone is on the same page and get everyones questions answered. She would speak to the DON (who was out of town this week) to see if that would be something they should do. She will follow up with me on training needs. All of her questions were answered for now. She was happy to know that she now had one point of contact, instead of calling client support and speaking with different people and sometimes getting different answers. She informed me she would likely call me frequently to ask additional questions as they came up. We established that she would be my point of contact instead of Brittany, as she is the primary one heading up abaqis."

This was a very difficult training, the MDS nurses struggled to understand the MDS Indicator Rates and MDS 3.0 reports. I reviewed the Staff Interview, Resident Observation, census and admission record reviews. They plan to extend their sample and conduct the assessments we reviewed. They struggled to understand the assessments and MDS reports, so I did not review any other reports.

5004V000011UtgKQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (9/24/20): Training completed with 4 staff members. These included: Todd, Pat Philips (consultant), Anne (ADON), and their DON (possibly Arrabelle; I didn't quite catch the name). We got started about 10 minutes late because they were waiting on additional staff. Those staff didn't show up, so we got started. She said they're busy with COVID testing, so that's why they didn't come. This training was an overview of abaqis, as none of the staff were really familiar with the program. Prior to training, I noticed they didn't have logins. I went to the users list and Rey still worked at the facility. I explained that he could provide them with access. I then started going over navigation of the main dashboard. I went into the resident list and explained how the list was managed. They have PCC integration, so I let them know they didn't have to worry about uploaded MDS files. I also explained that they would go to the random QAPI samples to create a sample. I explained how workflows worked and the the FA and COVID were workflows. I explained the mange, tasks, and analyze sections for workflows. I then went and explained all the various features that abaqis offers and how they work. While explaining survey readiness, I showed them what the assessments looked like and went into the snapshot. I showed them the PAC assessments. I also showed them the PIPs and QAPI plan explained how those templates worked in abaqis. I went into the reports section and showed them all the reports that could be ran and briefly explained them all. I showed them a couple of the PAC reports and explained that they could still get some information from the reports based on MDS information, without completing the assessments. Explained they get more detailed information if they complete the assessments. I also briefly showed them and explained the SBCA. I then finished up by discussing the help and training resources link. We went over the various tabs. There were no questions throughout the training. Todd expressed that it was a good overview and there weren't any questions at this time. I asked when they thought they may get started and he thought they would definitely be looking at it in about a month or so. That is when their survey window opens up."

5004V000011UtgmQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (12/6/19): Training completed with Tan (DON), Christina (Unit Manager), and Karen (Case Manager). We got started about 15-20 minutes late due to them logging in late and having audio issues. Tan has been at the facility for 4 months and has never used abaqis before. They all knew how to log into abaqis and knew what they're logins were. I started out by explaining what abaqis was and it's different features. We then went through basic navigation. They had many questions about their resident list and why residents were being shown as active, when they had discharged. I informed them that MDS files had not been uploaded since 11/5/19, so it's possible they discharged in that amount of time. I also went over resident management and explained how they could manually discharge residents if they wanted/needed to. We discussed their cycles/deadlines since they are on CSM. Informed them a new sample would be generated 1/1/20. We discussed how to complete the assessments and briefly discussed each one. I emphasized the importance of comments. We then discussed the SBCA and MDS reports. We went into their snapshot and I explained how to complete an investigation using the CE pathway. They only had a few areas with red exclamation marks because it was only MDS information, as no assessments were completed. I finished by discussing the help and training resources link. They appreciated the information and expressed that the training was very helpful with understanding everything. I provided them with my contact information and encouraged them to reach out with any questions. Session 2 (3/5/20): Training completed with Tan (DON). This was an investigations training. I asked if she had run any reports and she said she couldn't figure out how to. I took her to the reports tab and we discussed the SBCA and MDS reports. Explained how to run them, interpret them, and use them for the investigations. I then went to their current investigations snapshot and explained how to navigate it. I asked if she was familiar with the CE Pathways and she said she was very familiar with them. She said she used them for mock surveys before. Explained the pathways are what we recommend using for investigations as well, which would be the same as what she did. I went through the Un Med pathway and explained how to complete the investigations in abaqis, answering the ftag questions. I explained how to complete the investigation using Guidance to Surveyors. We discussed a facility level task and how to complete those. I then reviewed how to complete a facility task. We discussed how to prioritize the care areas, how many residents to complete in the various care areas, and dividing up the workload. Tan didn't have many questions throughout. She thought the investigations would be pretty easy since she's used the pathways before. She said she'd get together with the team and tackle the investigations. "

Started with overview of what abaqis does and what it has to offer and then continued on to cover the SBCA report with their data. We went over the MDS report in the training site. Their MDS uploads are up to date by PCC, but no data is showing in their site. I will report to Cindy to take a look at. We then talked about how the data from the qapi assessments related to the investigations and using the reports to decide on areas to investigate and which residents. Cheryl felt this was very helpful for them to understand how the data that is collected plays a part in identifying problems. Allen mentioned that Bryan has not made a decision on the cycle or sample sizes. Cheryl spoke up and said Bryan was going to get back on board with all homes in February because he is currently serving as a director in one of their facilities. Mitch and I discussed once he gets on board a Client Needs Review to determine their training needs as well. Allen will decide on a date in January or February for our next training."

Charity said that Kathy (corporate) wanted to be on the call, but she was in survey mode, as another facility was getting the annual survey and was hoping to exit today. Charity said that a lot of questions had come up that they wanted answers too. Their biggest question was related to why residents who had discharged were still in their sample. She said that in their assessment, they would complete the assessment and write that they had discharged, etc. I explained how the ""auto replace residents"" works and that they cannot complete any assessments if they want the system to replace them. We discussed MDS uploads in regards to managing the resident list and discharging residents. I walked them through how to manually DC residents and how to manually replace residents in their sample. Charity said they were getting ready to start a new sample and she wanted to make sure she understood that. They asked about how often they should be doing the assessments. We discussed the cycles of abaqis and what those would look like - explained assessments and investigations are the two phases of a cycle. We discussed the investigations. They were questioning why residents were chosen for Unnecessary Medications. I showed them where the help document was and we discussed this. They then had questions about the Correction Action and Vision Problems and why residents were chosen for that. I took them to the MDS report and brought up that section. Explained that that if someone is coded for something other than adequate vision and they do not have glasses, then that trigger's out. Charity thught they may have a coding error related to that, so they will look into that. She really appeciated me explaining that, becuase they did not understand that section. They asked how they see the results of their investigations, so I showed them the Investigations reports. We specifically went over the Ftag report. A few other questions were asked. All questions answered. Charity expressed that the training was very beneficial for them and cleared up their questions that they had. I expressed that they can always reach out to me if they have any additional questions. Charity said that Hebbronville was going to start using abaqis again and that Meridican Care was using it. Charity mentioned that Kathy was wanting another onsite training to get additonal facilities started with abaqis and trained. Charity mentioned they would reach out to schedule a call. I expressed that that would need to go through contracts to get additional facilities enrolled, but I would be happy to do that additional training. I told her that I would have contracts reach out to Kathy. "

5004V000011UtguQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session #1-TG on 2/27/20 with Alexandra Henry DON and Connie Miller MDS nurse. They needed a overview on QAPI Assessments and help creating the sample. We hit the highlights on the QAPI assessments since they were familiar but it has been awhile. Alex was interested in the training platform for the staff that will be helping with the assessments. She will meet with them to get them going and thought the videos might help. She will send the staff and emails to me to get them set up. We set a date on 3/24/20 at 2 pm est. to review their data and go over qapi reports.  Session #2-TG-9/25/20 with Alexandra Henry DON. Alex was late joining. I called the facility and they stated she was doing Covid testing. I asked if she was going to join the meeting they put me on hold again and went back to ask her and she said she would join. She stated they had done a QAPI plan but it is not in the Facility QAPI plan. I explained the difference in Corporate Template vs. Facility. Their QAPI Plan is in the corporate area, however several areas were incomplete. Alex stated that was a lot to remember with the differences of why and how to activate a corporate template when they were just a single facility. She will go in and said she would get it in the right place and get it completed. She also had a question about the facility assessment. We reviewed their data and found the FA incomplete also. We walked through some of the areas she had completed and she remembered how to do it, but she asked why did the system allow you to save a area if you hadn't put information in to the FA. I explained that she needed to complete each section and ensure every area was complete before saving that section. She again stated that was a lot to remember to do. She will go in and finish and ensure all areas are complete and saved. She did not need any training on PIP's. She will get the qapi plan and FA up to date and will let me know when she needs more training. She stated Covid has kept them very busy.   Please remove Kathy Blair from Salesforce. She is no longer a employee there."

They will take 12 weeks go conduct assessments for 6 census residents and 3 admission residents. They feel they know abaqis well enough now that they will reach out to me with any questions or additional training needs. I walked Kelly through how to update the their facility assessment and print. Their MDS Indicator rates report is missing resident for example. A resident was not included who for alzheimers or dementia even though they are an active resident is abaqis and his MDS was coded I4800 with Alzheimers or dementia.

She went in and copied a previous FA, started a QAPI Plan and wanted a walk through on PIP's. We went through her live site on her FA and QAPI Plan. We discussed all the areas. I then jumped into the training site for a few areas to review, including the PIP. She seems very tech savvy, stated she was previously military and you were given a manual and told to go do it. She stated that is what she did with the qapi tools over Labor Day weekend. She stated she did get a little overwhelmed, but felt after today's session she had all her questions answered. She stated she tried to do it on her own before getting trained today because one of the consultants was coming in today and she wanted to review with her what she had done so far. We discussed boiler text and ensuring that the FA and qapi plan was unique to their facility. She stated everything came together after we walked through the different sections of the FA and qapi plan. She thought the PIP was well laid out to use. She will start on a PIP today with the consultant and go back in to pretty up the qapi plan and FA. She will reach out if she needs any help on them to her consultant or me. She will get these done and decide what to do next and let me know. I informed her that Misty was deciding on a refresher for all homes and she would send out topic and dates when they are decided.

5004V000011UthFQAS,Corporate Implementation Series 2,"Session 1 (4/29/20 - Kayla Harwell): Training completed with Maryruth, Michael Brown, and Andrew Taylor. Michael and Andrew are both new corporate employees. One will be working in Coeur D'Alene ID and one will be working in Lewiston ID. Both knew how to login, but hadn't logged in yet. This training was a general overview. I started by explaining what abaqis is and then moved to navigation while explaining the various functions of abaqis. I also informed them of what their current implementation plan is while explaining survey readiness. I then went and explained the various corporate reports. No questions throughout the training. Maryruth said she had never looked at the corporate reports before, so she liked seeing that. She said I did a very good job explaining things. Maryruth said that when Michael and Andrew go to their respective facilities on Monday, they will be taking part in doing the assessments and running reports, so they will get familiar with the process. Maryruth did not want me to go into anything in detail. Session 2 with Sue Goodrick, sgoodrick@cascadiahc.com she is very familiar with abaqis and is now a corporate nurse. We reviewed the corporate reports. This was not a training but a discussion. Don't send evaluation Session 3 (9/15/20 - Kayla Harwell): Training completed with Michael Brown and Peggy. Peggy asked how she got a login. I explained how Michael could add her as a user. (Following the training, I noticed there was a Peggy that had a log in, she just hadn't logged in before) Both Michael and Peggy are training to be administrations and just have a couple of months left before they test. Michael said that he's been in trainings in the past and they were more of an overview of things. He understands what abaqis is and what all it does, but he didn't know what reports he could run or what the reports offered as well as some more detailed things about abaqis. He wanted to dig into the more clinical aspects of the program and how to see the information that gets put into abaqis. I started out by talking about the corporate reports and how those reports showed more of an overview - as far as sample progress, which homes had facility assessments, etc. We then dug into a single home and I showed them what reports were available. I showed them the SBCA and MDS and explained how to interpret the reports and view the information. We briefly talked about a couple other reports as well. Peggy wasn't too familiar with abaqis and how it worked. She asked how to get to the assessments to do them. I showed them how to navigate to the assessments and start them. I then explained the snapshots and the investigations process, as this came up as a question as well. Discussed how to use the purposeful snapshot. Went into the QAPI snapshot, and explained the triggered areas and the various columns and briefly went over how to do an investigation. I then took them to the PIPs section and showed them how to view PIPs at facilities, etc. Michael asked about the meeting minutes on the PIPs and I explained that would be where they would document their minutes for the PIP. I then took them to the meeting minutes section in abaqis and explained how they could use that to document all the meetings that they have. Throughout training, Peggy would ask a question and then Michael would explain things to her and I would add anything additional if I needed to. Michael is very knowledgeable of the program and it's purpose. Michael expressed that he thinks abaqis is a great tool and he was a big advocate for it. All questions were answered. They appreciated my time and all of the information."
5004V000011UthGQAS,LOT Package Continued,"Session 1.   Alpana requested this call to chat about the mock survey process vereses doing a mock workflow.   Her three homes are on hold right now with abaqis activities dt COVID but she wants to conduct a mock survey of some type in all three homes before the end of the year.  We spoke about many...many options for doing this.  We forst spoke of the MOCK workflow but she is doing this all  y herself and after a review she wanted to do somethihg some focused on what she can do on her own.  We then moved to the clasic dashboard and spoke about a QAPI sample or her creating a group to conduct the mock on.  She ssid she is very time limited and she up to speed on reviewing QM, Casesper reports, MDS and many other data sources for each of her homes so she stated she really already knows for the most part what she wants to focus on for each home as she feels like she know where their trouble areas are but she also sees value in doing a few residents that would include having her do all QAPI assessemnts for them as she feels like even though she thinks she knows where the issues are she likes the questions in the QAPI assessments to ID areas she and her team are not aware of.  A challanging aspect is she wants to do alot of this remotly...as much as she can.  They have EHR so there is a lot she can do off site so we spoke indepth how that might look for her.  She also wants to do this in 3 days as she is stretched very thin with other dutie but feels the mock is a muct do for them.  She will include all facilty level tasks and we spoke about how these could be distributed among other administrative team memebers at the individual home level and I could assist with eduction for them on conducting the individul facility tasks.  We spent an hour reviewing many options and she plans to talk with the admin staff at each home and begin looking at dates in probably Sept or Oct.  We plan to regroup in Sept to finialize the plan but for right now she does not plan to to use the Mock workflow.  SHe thought is would be great for a team of staff but she is one man show she said and she has to punt to make a different option work.   "

We further discussed the rationale for conducting some investigations and they did identify some MDS coding issues. By the end they were a little more engaged with the investigation process especially when I showed them how to manually add residents to care areas.  Session 3 with Renee, reviewed snapshot, MDS 3.0 report and MDS Indicator Rates reports.

5004V000011UthTQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 - Lisa and Beth showed up 10 minutes late. They forgot what time the training was. Lisa provided me with a history of their use with abaqis. Both Lisa and Beth have been at Rice Estate for about 2 years. They have worked together for 7 years in other facilities. Neither of them had used abaqis before they came to Rice Estate. Their VP of Clinical, Theresa, is the one that ran abaqis and now she is gone on permanent medical leave. They would do the assessments, and Theresa would do all of the reporting, the FA, etc. Now that Theresa is gone, there was no one in the company to tell them about abaqis. They are wanting to learn more about abaqis and how everything works. They were hoping to do training over 2-3 sessions, or however many is needed. Lisa said that right now, her staff were completing all of the assessments for all 80 residents and she was giving them until Monday to complete them all. They liked abaqis, as it was a great tool to use to identify weaknesses and identify risks. They had never done investigations before and had never looked at reports. We discussed how to input all of the assessments into the computer. Some assessments were already in abaqis, so their staff must have figured out how to do it. We then discussed managing the resident list. Some residents were still in the list and they had discharged awhile ago. Explained it's managed by the MDS - it's possible the DC MDS hadn't been uploaded yet. Their MDS uploads were up to date. I showed them how to manually discharge residents. They planned to print the resient list and have MDS upload their DC MDS. We then discussed reports - RI, MDS, SBCA, and Summary by Resident. We then discussed the investigations briefly. Talked about the QAPI snapshot and CE pathways. Will likely need to discuss this further. This was a very interactive/engaged training. Many questions throughout. All questions were answered. "

LeiAnne (NHA) from Mooreland was on vacation and her DON and QA nurse did not show up. We discussed their struggles with the program. Julie explained that they get all of the assessments completed and gather all of the information, but then she doesn't know what do with the information and where to take it from there. Johnna agreed and said the assessments were pretty black and white, but she didn't know how to use the information. They also expressed that their key issue was time. They don't have enough time to complete abaqis. They have a lot of other things going on. I asked about their team size and they do not have big abaqis teams, but were hoping to increase the size. I asked about how often they were doing cycles. Julie said they started off quarterly, but are now doing it 2x/year. Sarcoxie just got out of their survey, so are not in their window - will be in their window early next year. Brunswick is currently in their window - last year they came at the beginning of October. We discussed training and they both agreed that they wanted separate trainings. That way training is more individualized and it would just be easier. Both have had staff turnover and need new staff to be trained. Julie and I scheduled training for Thursday Aug 22nd at 11am. She wants to start from the ground up - so start with the basics and go from there. Johnna asked me to send her my contact info and she would meet with her team to see what works for training. Scott said he would email LeiAnne to let her know what was covered and will include me on the email.  Scott and I had a quick phone conversation after training to 'debrief'. "

5004V000011UtifQAC,Implementation Series 1,"10/22/19 - 1 hour basic overview training session with: Lesa, MDS Marilyn, MDS Melissa, Resident Care Coordinator Robin, DON Crystal, Data Entry Barb, Infection Control Sent a followup email with resources to Lesa.  Session 2 (4/15/20): Training conducted with Lesa (MDS) and Marylyn (MDS Assistant). This was an investigations training. They had not used the snapshots/investigations in the past. I initially asked them about COVID. Lesa said they do not have any cases in their building and have 4 cases in their county. She thought things were going well. We started out training by discussing their current process. When they complete their assessments, they take the information to QAPI and do a PIP if needed. They handle problems as they come up as well. I inquired about what she takes to QAPI and she said the reports. She prints the RI, FI, SI, RO, CR, AR, SBCA, and SBR reports - so all of the QAPI Assessment reports. She said she looks at all of them and if an area is triggering she digs deeper into what the problem is and then that's what she brings to QAPI. I asked about the reports and if she needed me to explain them at all and she said she was good with the reports and understood them. I then went and showed them how to create a snapshot. I created it from their Q1 sample. I explained the purpose and how it works. I explained how to navigate the snapshot. I then explained how to do an investigation. I went into the Un Med care area. Explained to choose 5 residents to complete. I went over the CE Pathway. Lesa said she was kinda familiar with pathways. I then showed them how to document and answer the questions within abaqis. Lesa asked about the reports so I then went and explained the 3 investigations reports. I went back into the snapshot and explained the Guidance to Surveyors areas and how those work. I explained using the SBCA report to help select the residents for each care area and recommended selecting 3 residents for each area. I then went into the Facility tasks and showed a couple of those - dining and med administration. I asked what they thought of the investigations and if she thought it was overwhelming at all. She said she was glad there were pathways to use and thinks things will go well. She didn't seem to be overwhelmed. I then went into the help and training resources link and showed them where the CE Pathways were housed. I then discussed cycles and explained that typically a sample is completed and then a snapshot is created and then when that's completed they repeat that and create a new sample. I showed them the QA Cycle worksheet and showed them different options for cycles. They thought they wanted to do things quarterly but when asked if they would be able to complete a sample in 6 weeks or so, they didn't know if they could do that. I did explain they could essentially do both at the same time if they wanted to. Marylyn could work on the sample and Lesa could work on investigations. Lesa said she would speak with the admin staff and see how they wanted it to be done. All questions answered. Lesa expressed that abaqis made a whole lot more sense to her now that she learned about the investigations. She didn't really get why they were doing abaqis, but after our training, she understood. I encouraged her to reach out with any questions as they get started on investigations and at any time if things come up."
5004V000011UtiFQAS,Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (9/3/20): Training completed with 12 staff members, including Vishal. Vishal said it was the whole team. They went around and introduced themselves, but it was hard to hear. I believe the staff included: Vishal (NHA), Christine Gonzales, Kathy Goldberg (Marketing), Vic Camacho (IT), Keri Joseph (Dietician), Robert Manuel (Maintenance), Irma Santiago (Activities), Heather Carpenter (Rehab), Anita Vescio (SS), Jennifer Job, Catherine LaChica (MDS), Charline (I believe is what I heard). This was an abaqis Overview. I started out by discussing what abaqis was, the various features it offered, and the value. I then went into navigation and showed them how to navigate abaqis. This included going over the help and training resources. Vishal had me pull up the CoreQ form. He questioned why the exclusion criteria was not on the form. I explained that within the CoreQ workflow, it includes the exclusion criteria, but the form didn't. We then went to create a new random sample. I went into the residents and I explained how the resident list was managed. They saw residents that were discharged but still showing as active. Some had discharged quite awhile ago. I explained that it was likely because the discharge MDS did not get uploaded into the system. The MDS nurse said she uploads everything and it shouldn't have been. I explained that it's possible they weren't uploading files for a certain time and that's when it got missed. Abaqis was showing 135 active residents and they indicated their ADC was normally about 80-90, so there were a lot of discharged residents in their list. I explained how to manually discharge the residents. I explained that once they manually go through the list, the list should remain accurate as long as MDS files are being uploaded, as the list is managed by MDS uploads. I had to explain this a couple of times, because they kept thinking they had to manually manage the list and I reiterated that MDS files manage the list. I encouraged them to reach out to CS if they continued to experience issues after they went through and manually discharged the residents. We then created the sample. Vishal wanted to keep the 40C and 30A. We put the end date at Nov 2nd, as he thought they would probably take a couple of months to work on the sample. I then briefly discussed each assessment - RI, FI, SI, RO, CR, AR. I emphasized the importance of comments. I finished by discussing the SBCA. We went over by a couple of minutes to cover everything. All questions answered. I encouraged Vishal to reach out if they had any questions or needed anything."

5004V000011UtisQAC,Implementation Series 1,"10/8/19 abaqis Training for New abaqis User: Nancy is new to abaqis. This is a live online training to get her up and running. Session 1 (10/8/19 - Kayla Harwell): abaqis Overview completed with Nancy Funt (QA Director). Nancy is the new QA Director, so she wanted to learn about abaqis so they can start using it again. She said she has been QA in a hospital and was still getting used to a nursing facility. I used the 3 PPT slides from LOT 1 to discuss what abaqis was. I went over basic navigation (discussing reports, manage tab, meeting minutes, notifications, help and training resources). While in the manage tab, I showed her the MDS Indicators report. I informed Nancy that they had not uploaded MDS since 2/26/19. She did not know that MDS had to be uploaded into abaqis, so she will speak with MDS and have them complete this. I educated her that a lot of things in abaqis rely on MDS data. We discussed how to create a sample and discussed sample sizes. Nancy did not want to create one, as she wanted to wait until the MDS files were up to date. Nancy was very interested in the CE Pathways, so I showed her where those were. She said they currently do 6 pathways a month. She divys them up to the team (ex. Activities does activies) and they pick a resident to complete them on. So they seem to be very familiar with pathways. She thought she may be the only one to do abaqis. I advised her to get more of the team involved. She said she had some PIPs she wanted to put into abaqis, so I showed her how to start a PIP. She said she played with that back in July. She had questions and made comments throughout the training. All questions answered. She said she wanted to get into abaqis and play around with it and then she would likely have more questions. I provided her with Tracy's contact information and showed her where Client Support's contact information was. She express that this training helped her to realize what all abaqis can do and thinks it'll be a very good program. "

5004V000011UtiXQAS,Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (8/18/20): Training competed with Sandy Kingsley, Angela Raudebaugh (HR Director at Colonial Manor), Jamie June (Corporate HR), Sharon Eyster/Bixler (Dir of Operations/Corporate). We discussed ESE. ESE was enabled and they all received permissions yesterday. I asked how they were planning on doing ESE in their buildings and Sandy said they haven't figured out how it will work and who will do what yet. I started out by showing them how to create the survey. While showing them how to select the categories of questions, I referenced the document CS sent that has all of the questions on it. I then went to the report and discussed it. I explained that whoever creates the survey will be the only one that can view the results of the survey. The results will have to be shared. I showed them where to download it and said they could save it and email it to others or print it. Sandy then asked about using this for their personal cares and IL and asked they they could just name the survey something different so it's identified. I explained that she was correct. They would just create separate surveys for their buildings and disburse the link, since the URLs are unique to each survey. I explained that the only thing we couldn't do is create a user for personal cares or IL, It would have to be corporate or someone like HR at the nursing facility. I inquired a bit about the personal cares and IL. The personal cares are a separate building from the nursing home. Typically they're all on one big campus. Sandy asked if someone at corporate could create and disburse the surveys and then they could share the results when it was done to the appropriate people. I confirmed they could do this. I also made them aware they could share the results at any time, it didn't have to be finished. They should share them when it's half done; just as long as they had at least 10 responses so the report shows data. All questions were answered. They thought ESE was pretty easy and they all thought it was very user friendly. Encouraged Sandy to reach out if any questions came up. Session 2 (8/18/20):  Training completed with 27 staff members from all homes. Prior to the training, a calendar invite went out and 6 people did not show up that originally accepted the invite. Sandy was also on the call and was the one that spoke at the beginning and end of training. The staff on the training included: Sandy Kingsley ? Dir of QAPI (corporate);  Tempest Gagnon ? Unknown at corporate;  Kelly Grimaldi ? NHA at Attleboro;  Kim CurryLee ? RNAC at Attleboro;  Michelle Mattthews-wild ? RNAC at Attleboro;  Kim Dwyer ? DON at Attleboro;  Pooja Sahota ?

RNAC at Colonial Manor.  Some staff may have been missed, as I asked them to put all staff names that were present in the chat box and some may not have done that. This training was a combination of staff that were completely new to abaqis and those that hadn't used in awhile. I started out by explaining how to login to abaqis. I then went into what abaqis was and the various functions of the program and the benefits abaqis provided. I focused on survey readiness. I discussed navigation with the new dashboard and classic dashboard - explained how to manage residents, went over the help and training resources, etc. I then went into how to create a sample and how to lock a sample first if they needed to do that. Following that, I navigated to the assessments and we breifly discussed the highlights of each one. I strongly emphasized the importance of comments for negative responses. I wrapped up by discussing the SBCA. There were no questions throughout. Sandy expressed she was very happy with the turnout for the webinar. She hoped that meant usage would increase. She said she would be sure to reach out if any questions came up. "

One DON attended via GTM which was set up by Carmelite System.  I forgot to request a list of attendees. Will see if we can still obtain a list of attendees from Sister Margaret. Training agenda included a review of the content in the two power point slide decks that were provided to the customer by their account owner,Tracy Cooley. 1. Overview of the Survey Process.-Surviving the Dramatic Changes of a New Survey Era 2. What You Don't Know Can Hurt You. Provider's False Sense of Security abou QAPI Training went very well. I only referenced the QAPI tool kits and RCA due to time limitations, but we discussed Root Cause Analysis at length. Attendees were made aware to reference RCA tools within the QAPI tool kits. Sister Margaret requested that I not reference abaqis during today's training session. Abaqis will be addressed with the DON's at a later point, likely at the start of the new year. Informed Sister Margaret that Tracy Cooley will continue to be her trainer/operation manager and that Tracy will be in touch following this training session.  "
5004V000011UtjrQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 2,"07/16/20- Training 5 was scheduled for PAC training, per Ursula request with no show.  Email was sent and Ursual is requesting to reschedule- will attempt for next week.  08/06/20- Training was conducted today with Wanda and Lori. Facility stated Ursula is no longer with them.  Training covered Snapshot Investigations and Facility Task Investigations, and also showing them some Navagation to Help and Training Resources and where to find the MDS 3.0 and SBCA reports to assist with investigaiton.   "
5004V000011UtjRQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 conducted with Emily we created the snapshot, reviewed the MDS 3.0 and SBCA reports to select care areas and residents for investigation. "
5004V000011UtjTQAS,LOT Continued Series,"Session 1 (9/23/20): Training completed with Mary-Beth. She gave me a little history at first. She said they started training a couple of years ago and they never finished. They've never fully used abaqis. She said it was a ""complete disorganized mess"". They're using CoreQ now and have used some QAPI stuff, but overall, they weren't using. She said when they started, it seemed cumbersome and took a lot of time. She wanted to understand things a little better. I explained the survey readiness piece of abaqis and how it works, starting with the sample. The assessments were what she was referring to as taking a lot of time. I recommended getting as many staff involved as they could - department heads and front line staff. When they started, they had all of their department heads helping, but they couldn't find the time. She said they're a very busy sub acute. They do 80-90 admissions and discharges a month. They have 62 long term residents. There aren't many staff that are just assigned to the LTC residents. They just have 1 SW for the building. I explained and discussed different options for implementation - such as doing cycles 2 times a year, so they have a much longer time to complete the different steps. Also doing smaller samples. She thought they may have a couple of staff they could task with doing the different assessments and she asked if they could just use a couple of staff. I explained that it wasn't recommended, but it could be done. I explained that abaqis was very flexible in how they wanted to implement. She then wanted to know what the other steps were. I took her to the reports and I explained the SBCA report. She asked about corrective action and where they could document that, if they fixed something right away after reviewing the report. I explained they could edit the completed assessment and document in the comment area what they did to resolve the concern and date and time stamp it. I also took her to the Immediate Action Plan and explained they could use that for documenting as well. I explained how important documentation was, especially when it came to survey. She said they really struggle with documentation in the building. She said they do a lot of stuff, they just don't take credit for it since they don't document. I then took her to the investigations and I briefly walked through how that function worked. She said she was familiar with the CE Pathways. I then went into the PIPs. They somewhat use PIPs - mainly just the meeting minutes in the PIPs. I walked through an example and then walked through how to fully complete a PIP. She then asked how to create a sample. When I went to the resident list, they had a lot of active residents. She said they started uploading MDS files when they started with CoreQ. I explained there was likely a long gap in uploads and that was why there were so many residents. I explained how to manage the list and discharge residents. I explained once she went through and did that, the resident list should remain up to date, if MDS files are being uploaded. I then walked her through how to create a sample. When scheduling the training, Mary-Beth expressed that abaqis seemed intimidating. After training, she said that concern was alleviated and she felt better about things. She better understood how things were supposed to work. She thought they would have an assistant do the assessments and then the QAPI team do the investigations. All questions were answered. I let her know about my upcoming maternity leave and that if she needed anything, reaching out to abaqis_trainers was the best, so it got to the right person."
5004V000011UtjvQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (8/20/20): Training completed with Ashley, Lisa (unknown last name and title), and Scott Anderson (Chief Nursing Officer). Scott arrived late. We went over the QAPI tools. We first started out by discussing PIPs. I walked through an example and then showed them how to create and complete the PIP. They also wanted to see what the QAPI Plan and FA looked like, to see if they maybe wanted to transition those over into abaqis. Those documents are currently outside of abaqis. I went through the QAPI plan first. I then went over how to create, edit, and print/review the FA. Ashley seemed a bit confused by the tasks section, but we worked through it. I emphasized how nice our FA is because of the resident population profile and the 'duplicate' option. They really liked those features of it and confirmed them a couple of times. All questions were answered. I encouraged Ashley to reach out if there were any questions or if she needed anything."

5004V000011UtkaQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 6/6/19: Attendees - Baljinder Grewal, DON; Christina Sylvain, Director of Recreation; Other staff were also there but I could not hear them when they gave their name. I asked them to type their names in the chat box, but nobody did. The MDS Nurse was present. I reviewed the Corporate expectation for completing the QAPI Plan and Facility Assessment in abaqis before their upcoming mock survey. Also reviewed the Corporate expectation to complete a Sample during Q1 and Q3, and Investigations/Facility Tasks/PIPs during Q2 and Q4. Christina said the Jean (the Administrator) is the abaqis manager and will make assignments for the Q3 Sample (Jean was not at the webinar). I showed them how to create a sample and Christina asked that I create their Q3 sample. There seems to be a lack of abaqis manager leadership at the facility. I will communicate with the Corporate staff during our next call (July) that it would be good for the Administrators to take part in the webinars. "
5004V000011UtkbQAC,Corporate abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Implementation Series 1 Jackie Cousins (Director of Operations) was the sole attendee. Discussed Help and Training Resources, notifications, and all corporate reports. Set-up notifications. Stated was not interested in receiving scheduled reports. Jackie had a question about doing investigations in QAPI snapshot as she was training the SSD. Discussed SBCA and using comments to guide investigations. Many of the QAPI assessments did not have comments for negative responses. Verbalized understanding of the importance of comments to guide the investigation. Talked about the investigation reports which should be used by homes during QAPI meetings. Discussed that homes should not only focus on results but also accuracy. Looked at Warren Health which completed 100 investigations and only identified one deficient practice. She question the thoroughness of the investigations. Verbalized understanding of corporate reports and stated the training better equipped her to know the reports she should be running. "

They were informed about the corporate requierment to complete their QAPI Plan and Facility Assessment in abaqis before their next corporate mock survey (which is July 2019). With Scott's permission I created their QAPI Plan and reviewed each sections. Also reviewed the Self-Assessment tool and created a new workflow for it. The Facility Assessment was created, again with Scott's permission. A very brief review of the FA was done. I told Scott there is a recorded webinar that he could watch and we could do another live training as well. "

I provided an overview of abaqis and how each facility is using it. All 3 facilities have recent samples and/or investigations completed. Frank and Keith are interested in turning on CoreQ (they are AHCA members) and also want the Mock Survey tool turned on for all 3 facilities. Will forward request to Client Support. Additionally, Frank and Keith would like to be added to abaqis as Users. I informed them that Harrison Saunders needs to add them. I told them they could have Harrison send me an email requesting they be added and I would add them. Harrison has never logged into abaqis."

Also a Q & A. Katie wanted to know how to generate a sample with fewer residents; how to manage residents in the sample (I showed  her how to turn on auto replace); If PIPs could be on-going, etc. I reviewed their current PIPs and identified missing data, such as, RCA and measures and reviewed reports to show how quality scores could be used as benchmark measures. They are currently looking at Activities as a QA area, so I reviewed the CE pathway for Activities with her. Per Katie, they are not going to do another sample until Q3. They are going to continue to work on PIPs and maybe do Investigations and Facility Tasks. Katie said she would contact me if she had any questions."

Angela originally requested a webinar to learn more about how abaqis can help them with Patient Safety. However, today  she said she wanted a brief overview to show her new staff how to use abaqis. I verified they all were added as users and reviewed how to log into abaqis. During the review, I also pointed out patient safety/accident data on the reports. I suggested we do another webinar on Investigations after they finish their current sample. Also reviewed Help and Training Resources."
5004V000011UtkgQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 9/18/19: Attendees - Laura Wilson (Admin), and Daisy Johnson (HR and QA): Reviewed their FA and provided feedback and suggestions. Also provided a format for completing the assessments and suggestions for who should be involved."

(Melissa Murphy, Administrator, was supposed to attend but got called away). Assisted Tamika to generate a new Random Sample per Melissa's request. I reviewed the corporate plan of 2 samples per year. Tamika and Nikki said they have completed assessments in abaqis. Nikki completes all the PAC assessments but was not aware to the readmission report. I showed her how to filter, run and print the report. Tamika was not aware of the MDS report, so I showed her how to run and print that report. They requested to end the webinar because they had other meetings but agreed to set up another training to review all the QAPI assessments."
5004V000011UtkHQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 2,"IS #1 08/10/20: Attendees - Karen Strohl, Infection Control; Donna Pendrak, ADON. Reviewed COVID-19 Self Assessment: Assisted with creating assessments and reviewed each section. Karen asked about other infection prevention tools so I reviewed the ad hoc Facility Task on Infection Prevention. Karen said she has a meeting scheduled with Maureen Bloch (retired Infection Control Nurse) to discuss documenting of resident and staff influenza vaccination status. I showed Karen the section in the ad hoc Facility Task where she could document the residents' vaccination status, but Karen thought an excel spreadsheet sharefile would work better for their purposes. Plan: check in in 3 weeks."
5004V000011UtkiQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 2,"Session 1 (2/26/20): Training completed with Holly, the new DON. She is new to abaqis, so we started with the basics. I started out by explaining the new dashboard and how to navigate. I then went to the classic dashboard and explained the survey readiness piece of abaqis. She asked about the snapshots and if she could look at the closed ones. I navigated to the most recent snapshot and explained it. Breifly explained the process. They had not completed any investigations in their snapshot. We then discussed some of the assessments (RI, FI, RO). She questioned whether the questions changed with each resident or stayed the same. I informed her that they stayed the same accross the board. I emphasized the importance of comments. She asked if they could print the assessments, specifically the RO and then input it into abaqis. I took her to the help and training resouces link and showed her where the printable forms were. I also explained the other tabs in the help and training resources link. I then explained the PAC section and we discussed the assessments. I then explained the QAPI Tools section. I showed her an example of a PIP to show her how our PIPs were set up. We finished by discussing a couple reports - The SBCA and MDS reports. All questions answered. She said she would go in and play around in abaqis and let me know if she had any questions. I will check in in a couple weeks so see if they have any additional training needs."
5004V000011UtkIQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"abaqis Overview webinar completed 1/31/19. Quite a few staff were present - approximately 10 staff members with Annie Zell (NHA) and Brittany being the leaders. Annie informed me at the beginning that they did not want the training to take 2 hours, they only had about 1 hour. I completed in about 1 hr and 15 minutes (but we did get started late due to staff still trickling in). Most of the staff were familiar with abaqis, but some of were not. I did a quick overview of what abaqis was and what it provided. Then went into navigation and through the help and training resources link. I discussed implementation briefly when Annie told me we could move on as they had already discussed that and were familiar with it. I created their new sample for them. I walked through locking their previous sample and then created the new one. We discussed options for the number of census and admission. We decided on 30 census and 10 admission. Their bed capacity was 61. They felt comfortable with the assessments, so we did not discuss those. I did remind them though about the importance of comments that are associated with negative responses. We then discussed some reports. I discussed the Resident Interview, MDS, and SBCA reports and encouraged them to run the SBCA and MDS frequently. We then moved to Investigations. I discussed the different snapshots and created a QAPI Snapshot in my training site. I reviewed how to complete the investigations using CE Pathways and Guidance to Surveyors. Showed them how to navigate the snapshot. Discussed prioitizing care areas and residents and discussed how many to investigate. We then discussed PIPs. I walked them through creating a PIP. Annie said that part of the training was very helpful. The group was very engaged throughout the training and asked a lot of great questions. All questions were answered. I provided them with my contact information so they could reach out to me with questions. Session 2 (10/23/19): Training completed with Kris (DON). I thought our plan was to complete the Needs Review and do an abaqis overview, but that didn't seem to be what Kris wanted. She started out with questions about creating a new sample. I informed her that they had not uploaded MDS files since 1/30/19. I walked her through how to upload MDS files. She could not find the files on her computer, so she was going to speak with their sister facility Heron's Key to see how they are uploading MDS. We did go ahead and create a sample (as I explained the residents who were gone would be replaced once the MDS files were uploaded). She decided to do 30C and 10A. I showed her how to ""replinish"" the sample when the MDS files are up to date, so they would have an admission sample. She wrote down all of the steps, so she would remember. After 17 minutes she said she had to jump off of our call and she would be in touch. She said she appreciated my help. She seemed very rushed. She didn't actually log into the webinar, so this training was completed by me guiding her through abaqis step by step."
5004V000011UtkjQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"LOT session 1 Attendees Stephanie Malone (LNHA) Robert Nemeth (DON) Stephanie stated that Christina Comillas is no longer employed at Affinity. Stephanie and Robert will co-manage abaqis,  Robert is familiar with abaqis and used abaqis as a mock survey tool at a prior home. Affinity currently use PCC for hospitalization readmission; however, hope to use abaqis in the future for risk adjusted rates. Stated wants to ESE permission. Was excited about the meeting minute and MDS indicator report. Plans on using the report monthly. Wants to start using customer satisfaction report.  Summary of training 1) Discussed the abaqis quality management system including survey-readiness, QAPI and customer satisfaction 2) Created a random QAPI sample of 40 census sample residents and 30 admission sample residents. The goal is to complete the sample within 8 weeks. 3) Demonstrated how to add users (see attached pdf) 4) Encouraged to mark calendar for October to ""duplicate"" residents for the Facility assessment  5) Encouraged to review QAPI plan and ensure it is fully operationalized by 11/28/19 when the RoPs go into effect 6) Discussed the MDS indicator report and meeting minutes 7) Refer to the ""Help and Training Resources"" link for pdf documents regarding many of the topics discussed during the training.      "
5004V000011UtkJQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"abaqis Overview webinar completed 2/1/19 . Approximately 12 attendees were signed into the webinar including Richard, DON, Kathy, Activities, Danny Ricks, Sally Enriquez, Grace Cabiles/Betty Martone, Director of Rehab, Allan Martone, and a few call-in staff that didn't have names. The DON did most of the talking throughout the webinar, the others did not say much of anything. They indicated that most of the staff members were new and were not present during our onsite training last year. I discussed what abaqis was and what it had to offer (used the PPT slides from the 4 session LOT trainings). I went through basic navigation with them to show them where everything is. Emphasized the help and training resources link. We discussed implementation and the resources to help with implementation. We discussed the different implementation options. They had already created a new sample for the quarter, so we didnt discuss creating one. I went through all of the assessments briefly and emphasized the importance of comments. We then discussed the reports - RI, MDS, and SBCA. I encouraged them to run their SBCA report frequently. We then briefly discussed creating a snapshot and completing investigations. Discussed CE Pathways and Guidance to Surveyors. I didn't go into too much detail. I told them it would probably be a good idea to have another webinar specific to Investiations. We then briefly discussed PIPs and I briefly walked them through creating one. Overall, they did not have any questions throughout the webinar. DON stated that she thought the webinar was good and would allow them to get started. I provided everyone with my contact information. Session 2 (12/6/19): Webinar completed with 5 staff members, including (SSD, MDS, Rehab, Abel (DON), and Paul (NHA). They had some difficulties getting into the meeting, so we got started about 10-15 minutes late. I started out with explaining what abaqis was and did some basic navigation. When I went to the reports tab, they inquired about finding out the results of the mock survey they had a few weeks ago, as they didn't really know what was found. I reviewed the deficiencies by Ftag report. They had 42 Ftags. They then questioned how PIPs come about. We discussed things that may need a PIP and explained that not eveything required a PIP. I then walked them through how to complete a PIP. We discussed cycles a bit and they said their sister facility does it quarterly, so they will likely want to mimic that. We then went and created a sample. We decided on 30C and 10A. Discussed completing the assessments. They thought they would likely print the assessments and have various staff members complete them. I showed them where to find the paper versions. I explained the importance of comments and they seemed to understand. We then discussed the SBCA and I again emphasized the importance of comments, as they didn't have many comments in their last sample. Paul asked about users. I told them that for anyone who had a login - they could use the ""having trouble loggin in"" link on the webpage to reset password. I explained that editing/adding users would have to go through Kathy or someone else in coporate. I explained that changing Abel's email was a one time thing and I was unable to do that any longer. Paul understood. Abel expressed that he really appreciated my time and the infromation. He said he felt good about things. I provided them my contact information and encouraged them to reach out if any questions came up. Abel said he really wanted to just get in and play around. He said he would reach out with any questions. Several questions throughout. All questions answered. They were very engaged."

In the training site, I demonstrated how to create a Mock Survey, replace and add residents, assign participants and access assessments. Also reviewed how to clean up the Resident List. Walked through the process of finalizing the sample for investigations and showed them how to access Investigations (care areas and facility tasks). Opened a care area investigation and highlighted the comments that are brought forward. Per Denise, the are familiar with the CE pathways so I focused on documentation in the comment box regarding compliance and non-compliance. Lastly, I showed them how to access the Investigations Reports. Per Holly and Denise, they plan to set up the survey and make assignments tomorrow, and start the survey on Wednesday. I offered to be on hand this week to assist if they have any questions. Provided my phone number during the GTM but also followed up with email to participants."
5004V000011UtkmQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 07/23/20: Attendee - Anita Pickney (Guest Services). Anita was interested in using abaqis Customer Sat scores to do a PIP. I walked her through the PIP template using the example of Food Quality (based on low Customer Sat Scores). Discussed RCA and showed her the help docs. Described how she could post the PIP on a story board along with the Customer Sat scores so everyone can see the progress toward the goal. Anita also asked me about a ""rounding tool"" to record residents that were rounded on, and concerns that were addressed. I showed her the Meeting Minutes and demonstrated how she could record resident names and concerns addressed. I also showed her the Resident Obs assessment (the currently only use the RI and FI), but she did not want to collect all of the data on the RO. Offered additional support and encouraged Anita to contact us with f/u questions."
5004V000011UtkMQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (10/3/19) - Training completed 10/3/19 with Lindsey (QA Nurse) and Bev (DON). We did an abaqis Overview to get Lindsey familiar with abaqis and refresh Bev. I went over basic navigation (discussing reports, manage tab, meeting minutes, notifications, help and training resources). While in the manage tab, I showed them the MDS Indicators report. Lindsey created a sample for them. We discussed the sample size. Bev didn't want to do too big of one because they were a small building and a big sample was difficultin the past. They decided on 15 census and 5 admission. I showed them how to start their assessments. Lindsey said she didn't need me to go over the assessments, so I didn't. I did emphasize the importance of comments for negative responses. We finished by discussing the MDS report and SBCA. Bev said she will speak with Lindsey and they will come up with an action plan together. I offered additional training if needed and emphasized that they can always reach out to me. Bev thought the training was a great overview refresher for her and she really saw the value in abaqis again."

Time did not permit for review of the PIP's, but they would like to reschedule a PIP's training session. They would prefer to work on their QAPI Plan and the FA before moving forward with PIP's as to not get too overwhelmed. Jacqueline acknowledged that they were not fully engaged with abaqis as she says they already conduct many of these same QAPI activities using their manual forms. Suggested they take a look at what is being duplicated and perhaps they could consider eliminating some of the manual activities if they are already captured in abaqis.  Shared the help documents ""getting started with the QAPI Plan and FA."" Also demonstrated where to find and review the current Resident Population profile under the reports tab. Jacqueline expressed that some of the cultural and ethnic data in the report was inaccurate. She said they have never had any residents admitted that were Hawaiian, Latino or Asian. Suggested she share the data with the MDS Coordinator for clarification. Also demonstrated how to duplicate and refresh their current MDS data within the FA.   Encouraged them to use the QAPI plan example as a guide. They asked good questions and were appreciative of the training opportunity.         "

There is a language barrier; therefore, one must provide training content in small doses.Josephine is engaged in the training and takes notes during the training. Consequently...the trainer must repeat content and go slow.  Even though we had  a reports training; she has not been running the QAPI reports and taking corrective action. She was concerned about the abuse allegation from a resident interview.  Session 2 with Josephine, reviewed how to add users, trained on COVID-19 Self Assessment. I tried to engage her beyond theses topics and she was not interested in talking about anything else related to abaqis.  Session 3 with Josephine.

5004V000011UtkuQAC,Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (2/21/20): Had 45 minute phone conversation with Julie (QA Nurse). She had many questions and I provided training with click by click instruction. Julie said she is the main one that uses abaqis. She has been at the facility since Aug 2019 and she has been using abaqis since then. She has basically self learned abaqis. The person that was doing abaqis before her, told her some stuff, but she has mainly self taught. We initially started discussing users. She said Hayley, the NHA hasn't been able to login for awhile. Her email changed so she hasn't been able to use the ""having trouble logging in"". I looked and informed her that there were 2 staff that had the ability to manage users and provided her the names. She expressed that she really wanted to better understand the different aspects of abaqis and use it to the best of her benefit. She has mainly usd the meeting minutes, samples, and PIPs. She said she was recently shown ad hoc facility tasks, so she asked about those. I explained how those could be used and also explained the snapshot function. Explained how the snapshots worked and breifly discussed the investigations process. I explained how she would create a snapshot. I then explained how it all works together - samples, snapshots, PIPs/corrective action. She expressed that it all made a lot more sense. I then questioned what she did with the information that was gathered in the assessments. She said she was the one doing the assessments, so she knew what issues were brought up. I asked if she knew about reports and she did not. I took her to the reports tab and I explained the SBCA and MDS reports. She expressed understanding of the reports. She then asked about rehospitalizations and I explained PAC and the various assessments and how PAC worked. She thought she would start completing those. She then asked about the new dashboard and how she would utilize the tasks, manage, and analyze sections. I explained those sections and how she may (or may not) use them. I showed her the MDS indicator rates report when talking about analyze.  Throughout our conversation she kept expressing how thankful she was for the information I was providing her and how helpful I was. She said she had been stressed about abaqis for awhile, and I helped alleviate that stress. She seems to really want to utilize abaqis well and I think they'll be great users once she gets the hang of everything. I expressed that she can reach out at any time with any questions she has. I provided her my email and phone number. I also let her know that I would reach out and check in periodically. She was very appreciative. All questions answered."
5004V000011UtkUQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Training #1 (abaqis overview w/2 new nurses): Training need identified during account management reach out with Jill. Scheduled the training with Ashley for two new nurses. Brittany Fryer - MDS Coordinator and Shanon Kackman - Inf Control Nurse. Both nurses were present for training conducted 3/6/19 at 8am MT/9am CT. I conducted an abaqis overview for these nurses. Neither one were familiar with abaqis or had any part in abaqis yet since starting at the facility. I went over what abaqis was and all it had to offer using the PPT. I then went over basic navigation. I showed Brittany how to upload MDS and explained the importance of uploading the MDS, referencing the resident list. I went over the help and training resources link - referenced the MDS upload help document. I then explained the cycles of abaqis and the random samples. I discussed each assessment briefly - emphasizing the importance of comments. I discussed the MDS report and SBCA report. I finished by briefly explaining the snapshot and investigations part of abaqis. I went into their snapshot they had opened and showed them what it looked like, how to navigate, and very briefly how to do the investigations using the CE Pathways. They were very quiet throughout training and did not have any questions."
5004V000011UtkvQAC,Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (11/21/19): Training completed with Chris (NHA). We got started about 20 minutes late (see obstacles). I started out by discussing the SBCA. There had not been any assessments completed for the current sample, so we used Q3 2019. While discussing the report, we found that there weren't very many comments made. I showed him the ""view"" function. I advised him to do some education with his staff on the importance of comments for every negative response. We then discussed the MDS report, MDS Indicator Rates, and the SBR. We discussed the customer satisfaction report. We then moved to PAC. I discussed a couple of the reports. We then went over the diffeent PAC assessments. He thought he may have his SW team complete those. He then asked about the QAPI Plan and him creating a corporate one. I explained that he should complete a facility level one and that if he went to create it, then it would pull over everything from the corporate plan, since the template was activated. He then asked about Ad Hoc Facility Tasks, so we discussed those. All questions answerd. I said I would reach out in a couple weeks to check in and he thought that would be good. Session 2 (1/17/20): Training completed with Chris (NHA). We primarily focused on the FA. I informed him that it was part of the regulation that staffing numbers are in the facility assessment. Explained that the trainers spoke as a group and there are a lot of states that are wanting to see staffing numbers/ranges in the FA and are getting cited for it. I showed him where he would put that information in the FA - in staffing section under how he arrived at the determination of sufficiency. I discussed the new resources abaqis had available. Disscussed the staffing and personnel worksheet as well as the population profile staffing ranges report. He said that the lower number for CNAs is what he was budgeted for. I also walked him through deleted a FA, as he had created one but didn't mean to. Exlained the tasks, manage, and analyze sections of the new dashboard. He then asked about creating a new sample. I showed him where to go to create one. He was going to work on getting the MDS up to date. He also inquired more about advanced accreditation. I showed him the accreditation report. His FA is marked as complete. He needed to create another sample and complete assessments to acheive advanced. Was unable to determine how many assessments needed to be completed while we were on the training. Will investigate this a little further. He apprecited all of the information discussed on the webinar."

Evelyn asked me to review the permission level needed to edit the QAPI Plan. I demonstrated how to edit the Users and add the necessary QA permission. They were very interactive and asked a lot of questions. They asked that I show them the QAPI Self-Assessment as well. They recently started a pre-survey QAPI Sample. I reviewed their SBCA report and identified false negative responses in the ADL RI and FI (this was confirmed by the team on the call). I also reviewed how to edit the assessment. Lastly, we briefly reviewed the Facility Assessment Workflow. They already have an FA outside of abaqis but wanted to upload it into the abaqis template. I showed them how to upload a document but suggested they also complete each section. Evelyn requested a f/u webinar to review their QAPI Plan progress in a couple weeks.

Both voiced that they were confused by our new release dashboard and also how to access and update their facility assessments. Sandra said she had watched the 2 minute video and had called into Client Support to help locate their closed FA. She reports that our Client Support team was very helpful in locating their closed facility assessment, but she still had questions and was uncomfortable with the new look and feel of the Facility Assessment. They are entering their survey window for several of their facilities and she really wants to be comfortable with 'updating' their facility assessments.

She said she was put in charge of abaqis in April and she was not familiar with abaqis at all. Her old building had abaqis, but she was just learning it, and wasn't very familiar before being put in charge. She said they made it through last quarter, but wanted to do things better this quarter. She said she assigned everyone their assessments and didn't have problem with that. She mentioned that the NHA wants to see reports, and she wanted to be able to explain them better. She wanted to better understand the investigations process.  We started out by discussing the SBCA report. While reviewing the report, the staff hardly made any comments. She said she got on her staff last quarter because there weren't any comments. I explained the importance of the comments when it came to the investigations. I showed her how to use the ""view"" button to take her to the completed assessment, which could help. She would talk with her staff again about the importance of comments. We then discussed the MDS report. We moved to the snapshot. I explained how to navigate the snapshot, prioritize care areas, and the number of residents to investigate. We reviewed the Unecessary Medication investigation. Reviewed how to complete investigations using the CE Pathways. We reviewed how to complete an investigation using Guidance to surveyors. I showed her how to manually initiate residents for dialysis, hospice, etc. We discussed the facility tasks and how to complete those. We reviewed the Investigation Reports.

I walked Mary through generating the Q3 data Snapshot and reviewed the Summary by Care Area report. Also showed Mary how to edit the RO assessment to correct a response.  IS #2 1/16/20 : Attendee - Mary Bishop Shirkey, QA Nurse. Reviewed the new dashboard and Facility Assessment. Mary had already been clicking around prior to our call and felt it was user friendly. I walked her through creating a new snapshot via the new dashboard. Also completed the Client Needs Review. Mary was not aware of the Customer Satisfaction Reports in abaqis. We viewed these together and I provided feedback regarding the number of respondents and usefulness of the report (they are a 34 bed facility and have a limited number of interviewable residents). I also told her about CoreQ but she did not want that turned on at this time."
5004V000011UtkZQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 5/7/20 : Attendee - Sabine Thomas (Administrator). Assisted Sabine via telephone. Instruction on creating and editing workflows, adding participants, and printing was provided. Walked Sabine through printing the FA and creating and editing the COVID-19 self-assessment. Sent a f/u email with an example of a completed COVID-19 survey. Encouraged Sabine to have other staff contact me for assistance with completing their sections of the FA. "
5004V000011Utl0QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (7/26/19): abaqis Overview completed 7/26/19 with 4 staff members. These staff members included Micki Besse (DON), Nicole Thibodeau (QAPI Coordinator), Ashley Jones (Inf Control), and Kiesha Williams (ADON). They confirmed that they did not have any knowledge about abaqis. I reviewed the first few PPT slides from Session 1, to explain what abaqis is. We then went into abaqis. I inquired about logins and whether they knew how to log in. They said they had logins and Nicole knew how to log in, so she would inform them. I then went over basic navigation (reports, manage tab, notifications, meeting meetings, etc). While discussing the resident list, I informed them that they may need to review their list and 'clean it up' with any discharged residents. I showed them how to manually discharge residents. I discussed the help and training resources and pointed out a few of the implementation resources. Briefly discussed the role of abaqis manager. We discussed and created their QAPI Sample. They decided on a census size of 25 and an admission size of 5. They asked how the residents were chosen and if it was based on how they're chosen on survey. I explained that the sample is competely random. I also explained how residents are chosen on survey. I then briefly discussed each assessment (RI, FI, SI, RO, CR, AR), highlighting the main things from each. I emphasized the importance of comments. We finished by going over the SBCA and MDS reports. There weren't many questions throughout and they said they didn't have questions 'right now'. I provided them with my contact information."
5004V000011Utl1QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 08/23/19 PB : Attendee - Sidney Nedolast (NHA) Sidney told me she only had 50 minutes because of another meeting she needed to attend. I reviewed how to generate a Snapshot and provided an overview of the snapshot. I reviewed the SBCA and SBR reports and explained how these reports are utilized in prioritizing care areas and choosing residents to investigate. I reviewed the PU pathway briefly (Sidney is not a nurse but requested the PU pathway review), and reviewed the Investigation Reports. We took a look at Investigation reports from previous quarters and I discussed how these reports would be used in QA, and possibly in determining PIP topics. At the end she asked me to tell her what she needed to do exactly. I confirmed that she was the abaqis manager and provided the following steps (which I will also email to her): 1) complete the current QAPI Sample; 2) Generate the Snapshot; 3) Review the SBCA and SBR reports; 4) Prioritize care areas to be investigated (and possibly residents within each area); 5) Assign investigations to appropriate staff, e.g., PU to DON; 6) Review Investigation Reports. She said that the webinar was helpful. I encouraged her to reach out at any time with questions."
5004V000011Utl2QAC,Corporate Implementation Series 2,"IS #1 07/23/20: Attendee - Judith Bennett (Administrator in Training). Reviewed the complete abaqis cycle and explained how it met the QAPI requirements. Focused on Investigation Reports results and discussed when to do a PIP vs Immediate Action Plan. Reviewed PIPs and QAPI help documents on RCA, etc. Judith has been so appreciative of abaqis and all it does for Vernon Manor. "
5004V000011Utl3QAC,Corporate Implementation Series 5,IS #1 08/18/20: Attendee - Erica Vargas (Activity Director at Windsor Gardens) During the webinar we reviewed the Activity PIP progress. Erica had not worked on the PIP since we last met but said she was required to submit something to QA. I suggested we focus on RCA and Interventions as the PIP lacked details in these sections. 
5004V000011Utl4QAC,Corporate Implementation Series 3,"IS #1 08/07/20 : Attendees (all from Benedictine) - Dazey, Emily    Exec Dir Ops, Benedictine; Garcia, Rey    Mgr RN Benedictine; Carver, Sabrina    Dir. Nursing, Benedictine; Shepherd, Holly    Asst. Administrator PMSV. Benedictine is brand new to abaqis. None of the staff had user id's but obtained them during our webinar via Erin Blunt. I provided a high level overview of abaqis and QAPI. They currently use a QAPI Plan and FA they developed by hand. They do not have their MDS files uploaded. "
5004V000011Utl5QAC,LOT Package,"Session 1 (9/2/20): Training completed with Joel (NHA). This training was a demo for the Mock Survey workflow. Prior to training, I inquired about COVID. He said they have been super busy with everything, but they have not had COVID in their building. They've worked really hard on keeping it out. I walked through the steps of creating the workflow, assigning tasks, completing assessments, reviewing the report, finalizing the sample, viewing the snapshots, etc. While walking through those steps, I explained how the mock survey was different from traditional abaqis and the benefits. Following the training, Joel was very excited about the module. He said he definitely saw the value in it. He had a few questions throughout the training and at the end. He was curious why we still offered traditional abaqis and why facilities would use that when it's not exactly relevant anymore and the mock survey is what surveyors do. I answered this to the best of my ability - explaining that we didn't want to take something away that facilities had used for years and the assessments for traditional abaqis were simpler with yes/no answers. He inquired if there was a cost for the mock survey and I informed him that there was not and it was just a feature that had to be turned on. He also inquired whether he could reach out with questions or help if he gets lost on where to go or where to click or something. I encouraged him to do this and let him know that was why I was here. He could always reach out and I was always here to answer questions and we could hop on a call or do additional webinars if needed. He appreciated this. He said he'll speak with the DON regarding the mock survey. He said he may want me to do a demo like we did today with her as well, but he would let me know after speaking with her. He indicated it may take some time to figure out how to implement the mock survey in their building. He thought they would likely start the workflow in October and that would give them the rest of the year to work on corrective action and make sure they've corrected things and are ready if survey comes. With traditional abaqis, he had the staff complete assessments on paper and then he transcribed it into abaqis. He plans to do the same thing with the workflow. They don't have a lot of laptops in the facility. He also wants them to focus on the critical thinking and not worry about the technology. He also likes to review everything before it gets put into abaqis. I showed him where the forms were and what they looked like. He said the training was very helpful and informative. He said he was sold on it and definitely wanted to activate the mock survey workflow. He thought he'd do some training with staff this month and start in October. Session 2 (9/17/20): Training completed with Janice Pate (DON). This training was over the Mock Survey workflow. Janice was familiar with traditional abaqis and has used those assessments. I walked through the steps of creating the workflow, assigning tasks, completing assessments, reviewing the report, finalizing the sample, viewing the snapshots, etc. While walking through those steps, I explained how the mock survey was different from traditional abaqis and the benefits/challenges. I explained that the staff that are involved should be those with critical thinking skills. When reviewing the questions, I explained they could ask all the questions, or just a handful of questions for each care area. I explained the risks of not asking all of them - that surveyors pick and choose the questions they ask and the surveyor could ask a question that they didn't ask. I explained that asking all of the questions would take a much longer time. I also explained that if they had been cited in the past for something or had issues in the past, they would want to be sure to ask the question associated with that (ex: being cited for choices related to bathing preferences - making sure to ask that question). It was ultimately up to them in how they wanted to instruct the staff. Janice seemed to understand the risk of not asking all of the questions. All questions were answered. She definitely saw the value in the mock survey and said it was really needed. It would be a lot of work, but would be worth it o see where they're at and be able to fix things. She thought they were going to start in October. She thought quite a few of the nursing staff would be involved. I encouraged them to utilize management staff. Again explaining that those staff with critical thinking skills should be involved. She appreciated my time and said the training was very beneficial. Joel is a big advocate of abaqis, has used it since it first came out, and I think he'll figure out a way to make it work. I anticipate them being successful with the Mock Survey."
5004V000011Utl6QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 6/20/19: Attendee - Karen Soehner, Administrator. The webinar was set up to cover new features in abaiqs and a Q & A. Karen shared that they had a deficiency free survey. She also shared that the surveyors were impressed with abaqis. Karen said she was thrilled they had abaqis and doesn't understand why their other facilities don't purchase it. Today I demonstrated how to use the Meeting Minutes and provided examples of how/when to use this feature. Next we reviewed the MDS Indicator Report and Karen had several questions about how far back the data is pulled and whether discharged residents show up on the report (I told Karen I would refer her questions to CS as I was not sure). We also reviewed their Customer Satisfaction report and I answered questions about the percent and percentile ranking and national benchmarks. The QAPI Progress report was reviewed. Lastly, we reviewed the QAPI Self-Assessment and process for creating a new assessment and viewing completing assessments.  IS# 2 1/9/20: Attendee - Karen Soehner, Administrator. Reviewed the new dashboard, tasks, manage, and the Facility Assessment. Karen asked me to demonstrate how to close their FA and create a new one. I also showed her how to add participants to work on the FA. "
5004V000011Utl7QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (7/11/19): Training session with Jo-C via phone. She thought survey could come at any time, so she had a few things to discuss. The first thing she wanted to discuss was creating a random sample. I walked her through the steps. She said their ADC was 94. We decided on a census sample of 30 and an admission sample of 10. She wanted to work on the sample until the end of September and then she could bring the reports to their QA meeting in October. Once we created their sample, she was questioning why there were residents who had discharged. We discussed that the residents are managed by MDS uploads. I looked at the MDS uploads and they were up to date. We navigated to the resident list. They had 151 residents in their active list - so a lot of residents still active when they had discharged. I explained that the DC MDS' may not be being uploaded. She would talk with their MDS. I walked her through how to manually discharge residents and explained that ther residents in the sample would be replaced once they became a discharged status. We then discussed the Facility Assessment and how to update that from last year. I explained the ""duplicate"" button and how to review the infomation to ensure it was still accurate and update it as necessary. We then disucssed the QAPI Plan and how to update that if needed. Jo-c expressed that the training was very helpful and she appreciated my help. I expressed that she could reach out at any time if she needed any more assistance.  Session 2 (7/17/19): Had a 20 minute phone conversation/training with Jo-c, as she had some questions. When I called her at 3:00pm CT, she was working on gathering entrance conference documents. She said survey had walked in that morning after their morning meeting. We discussed the QAPI Plan and what she needed to do to update it. She thought she messed something up becuase when she updated it, she did the Corporate plan and not their facility level plan. She thought having the Corporate plan was confusing when they are not a corporation. I explained that she did not mess anything up and she could just update their facility level plan. Did explain that it was not a regulatory requirement that the QAPI Plan be updated annually, but did explain that it should be reviewed to make sure everything is still accurate and the QAA members should be updated if there was any staff turnover, etc. She then asked about a template for falls. She said she saw the ones for Missing items and PU, but she wanted one for falls. At first I thought she meant something that gave suggestions for different sections, like the missing items and PU examples. As she continued to speak, it became clear that she was just wanting the headings that the examples showed. I explained that the 'template' was exactly what our PIPs are when you create them. She wasn't understanding, so I had her create a PIP. Once it was created she understood and said that was exactly what she was looking for and became excited. She appreciated all of my help. All questions answered. Session 3 (3/3/20): Had a 45 minute phone conversation/training to Jo-c. She said she had an emergency she had to take care of and apologized for not returning my call. She mentioned the caller ID indicated Healthstream and asked about that. Informed her that we were acquired by Healthstream. She said she met with Jessica with Medline not long ago and she had mentioned that we were now Healthstream. She asked if anything changed and I explained that abaqis was the same, our parent company just changed. She then went on to explain she used our QAPI plan and FA last year and provided that to the surveyors. She asked if she needed to update them. I explained that the FA regulation required it to be updated annually so I expressed the need to update that. I also explained there was no requirements with the QAPI plan but it's good to review periodically to make sure everything is still accurate. She asked if anything had changed with either of those and I explained that the FA had changed becaue there was a new release. We then walked through the FA process. I showed her how to create the FA. She was confused by the participants but we got through it. She then needed to add some users that weren't in abaqis. I walked her through how to create the users. We then went back and added them as participants. I then showed her how to edit the FA using the tasks list. I went through and explained sections. Explained how to mark the sections as complete. I then showed her how to view/print the FA in the analyze section. Explained the 'print for survey' button. At that point she seemed a bit overwhelmed and said that was plenty with the FA. She said she'd work on the FA for the next week or so and review the QAPI plan as well. She indicated she thought they may get their survey sooner than they've had it in the past. She wanted to focus on the FA and QAPI plan first and then they would start training/working on the QAPI assessments and going through that. She indicated they had 11 staff that would help. She said she would reach out if she had any questions with the FA and then would reach out about the sample. I'll review their site after next week and check in with Jo-c."
5004V000011Utl8QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"""Training 1"" - Overview completed with Tamera on 3/21/19. She said she started using abaqis about 1.5 years ago. She really didn't receive much training. They only had 4 staff members helping with abaqis before and she ended up doing all the work, so it didn't ever work for them to keep using it. But they are now wanting to get back on track and have a better outcome with using the product. She basically knew how to use it all, except she didn't remember the 'manage button'. We went over the manage button and what could be found in there. She said that Mike uploads the MDS and they just uploaded a bunch yesterday. We discussed the QAPI Sample and that can now be changed. She thought they would stick with 40 census and 30 admission. She thought she wanted to create a new sample, but I showed her their sample and how residents had been replaced because of the recent MDS uploads. She was OK with keeping the current sample. We went over the help and training resouces link and went through each of the tabs. We discussed most of the resources in the implementation resources, specifically the ones that I thought would be beneficial since she would be the one in charge. She did not want to go over any of the assessments, since they hadn't changed. I emphasized the importance of comments as they completed their assessments. We discussed the reports - RI, MDS, and SBCA. She wanted to get started on their sample next week. She only wanted to take a couple weeks to complete their sample. I explained that it would be a good idea for us to have an Investigations webinar when that time came and have everyone that will be helping as a part of the webinar. We scheduled that for April 8th at 9am CST. All questions answered. Emphasized that she can reach out to me at any time with any questions. Will send her the webinar information. ""Training 2"" - Investigations training completed with Tamera on 4/8/19. Tamera was the only one on the training. Prior to training, I noticed that many residents had discharged in their sample and for the RI, she was putting ""resident discharged"". The first thing we discussed was that. I showed her how to manually discharge residents by editing their stay. She said she did that with some of her residents, but they still didnt get removed from the sample. I asked if she had completed assessments on them by the time she edited their stay. She thought that she had. I then showed her how to manually replace the residents with the 'replace' button. She said that was very helpful. She planned to do that and re-do the assessments for the replacements. She said she hadn't gotten to all of the family interviews yet, but planned to start on them this week. Due to her still working on the sample, I did not create a snapshot for her, I just walked her though the steps in my training site. We discussed the SBCA and reminded her how to interpret the report. She said she had not run this report yet. I then walked her through how to lock her sample when she finished it and prior to creating her snapshot. I then walked her though how to create her snapshot (using my training site). I showed her how to navigate the snapshot. We discussed Unnessary Medications and a few other care areas using CE Pathways. We walked through the investigations process. We then dicussed Guidance to Surveyor areas and a few facility triggered tasks. I showed her how to manually add residents to care areas like hospice, dialysis, etc. We then discussed a few of the mandatory facility tasks. We finished the webinar by discussing the reports associated with Investigations. Tamera said that she was used to using the CE Pathways, so she didn't think the investigations would be that difficult. She felt comfortable. She really didn't have many questions, but all questions were answered. Session 3 (3/26/20) - Training completed with Tina, Amanda Stanley (ADON), and Evelyn Claiborne (DON). We got started about 10 minutes late because we were waiting for Evelyn to arrive, as she had a meeting prior to ours. We then went 10 minutes over our time. Tina said she was working from home and Amanda and Evelyn were at the facility. Amanda said that things haven't been too bad with COVID-19. She indicated it could be worse. Amanda and Evelyn are new to abaqis. Amanda has been in and played with abaqis a bit so she was a little familiar with it. Evelyn hadn't been in at all. Tina mentioned that Amanda would be using abaqis a lot more than Evelyn would. I started by doing navigation and explaining the new dashboard. I pointed out the COVID-19 resources available in abaqis and mentioned that I had emailed Tina resources as well. Tina then interrupted me and explained that Evelyn didn't know how to log in. I explained she would go to www.abaqis.com. I went into the users section and gave her her user ID. Tina did not remember what she set her password to be and she requested that I reset the password. I've never been asked to do that and when I went in to do it, the system allowed me to do it so I reset her password. Tina said Evelyn started 2 days before all of the COVID-19 stuff came out, which is why she couldn't remember. I then continued with navigation, showing them a couple reports under the analyze section (MDS Indicator Rates). I showed them how to manually discharge residents if they needed to. I then navigated to the classic dashboard. I explained the quadrants and their purpose. Tina really emphasized that they were the ones completing the investigations and I explained the purpose of abaqis and how it all goes together with survey readiness and QAPI. Amanda had already been working on PAC assessments. I explained what was a part of the QAPI tools. I then went into reports. I explained the SBCA and MDS reports. Tina indicated they could use the MDS report for their QMs and improving those. I then went into all of the PAC assessment reports and showed them how to run them. They did indicate they had issues with hospital readmissions. PAC seemed to be very important to them. When I reviewed the ER transfer report, there wasn't any data. I navigated to the PAC assessments and showed them how to complete the ER transfer assessment. I wrapped up by going into the Help and Training resources link and discussing the various tabs. All questions answered. They all expressed that the training was very helpful and they appreciated my time. Tina said she always learns something new when she speaks with me. I encouraged them to reach out if there are any questions that come up and I told Tina I would continue to check in with her."
5004V000011Utl9QAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session #1-TG-review of SBCA report of their data. Discussed the different snapshots and review of creating. Jessica stated she felt for their facility the QAPI snapshot would work best. If areas were in need of immediate attention she would fix them and then she could put the data in the qapi snapshot. She stated they are very challenged on doing abaqis d/t wearing many hats. She stated she will have only 4 hours a week on Tuesday 10-2 to focus on QAPI/abaqis. She works the floor on 3/12 hour days. She stated she had trouble getting the staff to give back their completed qapi assessments. She did f/up with them to get them done and hopes to have it completed by the end of next week. She feels comfortable creating a qapi snapshot at that time. She felt it would be less confusing to just do the one snapshot. We reviewed some investigations and how to link the Investigation reports to a PIP and corrective action. She would like to talk to the team and discuss the training platform. None were able to attend the training today and she thinks it will be beneficial for them to be able to watch an investigation module from the platform. She is working with them as they move forward with abaqis and she will let us know if she wants to provide staff contact information for the training platform. Jessica Konrade was the only attendee. Session #2-TG-review of facility's QAPI plan and review of PIP's. The only attendee was Jessica Konrade. She stated that she created the qapi plan without any input from others. She stated the Administrator will not participate. On the last survey the surveyors wanted to interview him regarding the qapi plan and FA and he called her in off of vacation and didn't want to talk with them. We talked about the need for him to be aware and the governing body and what the role is for both. Jessica was looking for more education, so she can in turn educate him. She stated they are going to start working on PIP's and she will have the DON supporting her as she develops them. Jessica was not aware of adverse events or how to monitor them, we discussed this further, reviewed the regulations that are related to qapi and adverse events. She wants to work on these areas and will reach out for further assistance after PDPM. Will continue to reach out."
5004V000011UtlaQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 3,"IS #1 07/10/20 : Attendees - Karri Gallagher (DON) and Barbara Bennett (Administrator). Reviewed the new dashboard and how to quickly access tasks. Reviewed the new format of the Facility Assessment and demonstrated how to edit each section and mark as complete. Showed them how to upload supporting documents. We also reviewed workflows and I helped them clean up old incomplete workflows and create a new QAPI self-assessment workflow. Lastly, we reviewed their QAPI Plan and I assisted with updating/editing QA members, etc, and also reviewed how to upload docs into the QAPI Plan, e.g. the completed Self-Assessment. They asked for another session next week to review the Investigation Snapshot and QAPI Distinction.  IS #2 08/06/20: Attendees - Karri Gallagher (DON) and Barbara Bennett (Administrator). Reviewed the FA uploaded documents and QAPI self-assessment progress. Assisted them with creating an Investigation Snapshot and provided a review of Nutrition Pathway.

GTM invite sent.  IS #3 08/12/20: (April Bernabe also participated in training) Attendees - Karri Gallagher (DON) and Barbara Bennett (Administrator). Karri stated they recently had a COVID survey and were cited for not following screening protocols. She said they are required to write a directed plan of correction with RCA. Karri asked for our help with  writing the plan. I suggested putting it into a PIP in abaqis. April and I guided Karri and Barbara through the process of identifying RCA for the failures, however, we suggested they continue to dig deeper and conduct more staff interviews to get to the full RCA. With Karri and Barbs' permission I added their responses into the PIP in abaqis. "

5004V000011UtlbQAC,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (8/22/19) - We had 2 attendees for training today. These included Julie Reichert (NHA) and Katie Boeger (Nurse Manager). Katie did not know anything about abaqis. Julie wanted to do an overview and go over the basics for Katie and Julie wanted to see if she would pick up on anything new/different. I started out by going over what abaqis is. I used the 3 PPT slides from the Session 1 LOT. We talked about the different features of abaqis. I went through basic navigation with them. We talked about the various reports (showed them the Trend analysis, Partner report, and Market analysis map), meeting mintues, notifications, the help and training resources and manage tab. I showed them how to manually manage the resident list with discharging residents. We discussed resident groups. I showed them the MDS indicator report. I also went over how to delete users. Julie inquired about whether she should delete users if they were no longer there. I advised her to delete them once they leave, so they can no longer see the facilities information. We discussed and created a new random sample as Julie said they needed to get started with a new sample. We decided on 20 census and 5 admission. We finished by going over the SBCA and MDS reports, as Julie expressed she wasn't familiar with those. While reviewing the SBCA, I emphasized the importance of comments when completing the assessments. Questions asked throughout the training and all questions answered. Julie expressed that this training was much better than the first time around and she thought she was understanding it better. I emphasized that I am here to help and they can reach out to me with any questions and any trianing needs. I will continue to follow up with Julie. Session 2 (10/30/19):  Investigations training completed with Julie. She informed me on how she had been completing the investigations. She had basically just been reviewing the records and answering the Ftag questions. She would make sure the information was in the record, she would review the MDS and care plans. She was going down the list of their triggered care areas and selecting the top 2-3 residents in them and was completing the investigations for them. I commended her on what she was doing. I asked about the reports and she said she hadn?t run any of them. I then showed her the MDS, SBCA, and SBR and showed her how she could use the reports to select her residents and see what their concerns were. She also had not been using the pathways. I advised her to also take a look at these. She was familiar with the pathways. She said she has a book of them and she uses them for training. I advised her to incorporate some observations into her investigations. They are currently in their survey window. I instructed her to look at 3 more residents for Un Meds. I also showed her the facility tasks, as she hadn?t completed any of those. I advised her to complete those, especially since they are in their survey window. She really appreciated my time and information. She said she was leaving on Friday (11/1) to go to Italy for 2 weeks. Session 3 (1/15/20): Training completed with 3 staff, including Katie, Tiffany, and Connie. Connie uploads MDS and Tiffany enters most of the stuff in abaqis. This training was requested by Katie so she could better understand the reports. We went through and talked about the majority of the reports in each section. Started out by discussing the MDS Indicator Rates report. Then we discussed the Resident Profile Staffing report. We then discussed the SBCA, MDS and SBR and explained how they are used. We discussed investigations reports, customer satisfaction, PAC reports, census development (partner report, market analysis map), QAPI, trend analysis, and the accreditation report. Also briefly discussed scheduled reports. There weren't many questions throughout the training, but all questions were answered. Katie said she needed to play with it some and then she may have some questions."

This week she wanted to review the Facility Assessment. Reviewed all parts of the facility assessments and discussed how they relate to survey readiness. Reminded her to ensure the FA's are update at least annually ad anytime there is a change at the facility that would warrant updating the FA. Provided a few examples. She conveyed understanding how to work through the FA. Also reviewed the help doc getting started with the facility assessment. Discussed the online training platform which would provide an opportunity to view our self-paced training videos. She also had a few questions about how to use the samples and QAPI investigation snapshots in coordination with their 72 hour admissions and reports. After much discussion, she opted not to go that route as the only feasible option would be to create a separate ""resident group"" and of course someone would need to manage the group as new residents were added to the 72 hour report. Next week's training agenda is TBD by Windy.  3/26/2019 at 2:00 PM EST (Paula) Cancelled  "

5004V000011UtlEQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 2,"Session 1 (9/6/19) - abaqis Overview completed with Katherine (DON) on 9/6/19. She said she started at Mooreland in February. She said she has an abaqis login and that was about all she knew about abaqis. She had not looked around much at all in abaqis yet. I used the 3 PPT slides from the 4 LOT sessions to introduce abaqis. We then went over basic navigation (reports, manage tab, resident list, resident groups, meeting minutes, notifications, help and training resources, etc). She does not have QA admin rights, so her navigation was limited. We discussed the sample and talked about the various assessments briefly. I pointed out the skip patterns, probing questions, and emphasized the importance of comments. We then discussed the SBCA and MDS reports. Katherine did not have any questions throughout the webinar. I advised her to get together with Michelle, since she has been heading things up and has been in charge. Katherine expressed that training was very helpful. Session 2 (12/4/19): Reports training completed with Michelle. We got started about 20 minutes late. She said she had clicked on every report, but she didn't fully understand them. She didn't know where the information came from or how to use them. We started with the QAPI Assessments Reports - specifically the SBCA, MDS, SBR. We then discussed the Customer Satisfaction report. Then the PAC reports. Michelle said they dont have many admissions and discharges, so there wasn't much information in their reports. We then discussed the Investigations reports. When discussing all of the reports, I explained where the information came from and how she could use the reports for QA, etc. She said the reports made a lot more sense now. She didn't think she was clicking far enough to get everything she needed. She thought she was quitting before she should have been. She inquired about changing her email address in abaqis. She said when she first got abaqis she didn't have a work email at the time, so she used her personal email. I informed her that LeiAnn would have to change that for her as she is the one with those permissions. She said she would speak with LeiAnn to get it changed. Michelle did not think she had any further training needs at this time. All questions answered."

5004V000011UtlMQAS,Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (8/23/19) - Training completed with Burton (NHA) and Tawnya (DON). We started out by going over the QAPI Plan. We created a new one. I explained they could edit the current one that was in abaqis from the previous NHA or create a new one. They preferred to start fresh and create a new one. We then walked through the FA. I explained the duplicate button. Burton really liked that. There were a few questions throughout, but not many. All questions answered. I provided them my direct contact information. They wanted to schedule the next training with the whole team. They thought they would have approximately 10 staff members. We scheduled training for September 27th at 1:30pm CT. We will go over navigation, create a sample, and discuss assessments. Session 2 (9/27/19) - Training completed with Burton (NHA), Tawnya (DON), and Shelli (ADON). They indicated they had a lot going on with PDPM coming next week, so no other staff members were available to attend. They first asked about the silver award through AHCA and they were informed that abaqis now had something with AHCA. I informed them that we now had CoreQ that could be enabled and explained what that was. I also explained that it was no extra cost. They would like this to be enabled. They inquired about any other features that had to be enabled so we talked about ESE. They would also like ESE to be enabled. I started out with going over basic navigation. We discussed the quadrants, the reports, the manage tab, meeting minutes, and notifications. While reviewing the reports, we went into the the Market Analysis Map. They seemed to really enjoy this feature. We went through managing the resident list, how to create a sample, and resident groups. I was then going to talk about the Help and Training resources, but they stopped me and said that they just wanted to focus on certain sections at a time. They thought they may just focus on ESE and CoreQ for now after those were enabled. I asked if tracking hospital readmissions were something they were interested in. They indicated it was and I advised that maybe we start there and focus on that and then we can branch off and discuss other things. I went through the Entry assessment. They then stopped me again and said they would work on the PAC assessments and then we could reconnect and maybe go over the PAC reports, and then focus on another section of abaqis. They appreciated the information. All questions were answered. Session 3 (4/24/20) - Training completed with Burton (NHA) and Tawnya (DON). Tawnya was present for about half of the training. I first went over navigating with the new dashboard, as Burton had mentioned difficulty with this when we spoke on the phone. He then asked about CoreQ, so I went over how to create the workflow and I showed him the questions and how to input the data. He asked about adding questions and I explained that he couldn't. I then briefly talked about ESE. Burton will be the one in charge of ESE and should have the permissions. We then went and discussed the survey readiness piece of abaqis. I explained the process and how it worked. We then created a sample. He decided 20C and 5A. I then explained the assessments - specifically the RI. Explained the importance of comments for negative responses. I finished by going over the SBCA and MDS reports. Burton didn't really have many questions. He indicated he didn't have questions right now, but he was sure he would as they got going with the sample. I don't feel like Burton was completely focused on our training due to some of his responses when I asked questions. He seemed distracted. I will plan to review their site within the next couple weeks and then check in with Burton."
5004V000011UtlNQAS,Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (1/20/20): Training completed with John Starner (MDS consultant/PCC guru) and Pam Campbell (pcampbell@libertynursingcenters.com - Clinical consultant). Sandy retired back in December. Pam replaced her and both John and Pam are taking over her role with abaqis. Neither one of them are familiar with abaqis, so this training was an overview training to introduce them to how abaqis works and the different functions of abaqis. I started out with explaining different functions abaqis could offer, while navigating around the classic dashboard. When we got to PAC, John asked some questions about it. He said the owners are requesting reports for rehospitalization. We discussed the assessments and the readmission rates report. I showed them all the reports that are available and discussed a few in detail (SBCA, partner report, market analysis). I showed them the corporate reports so they can monitor each facility. I showed them how the assessments are set up and then showed them how the investigations are set up and showed them a pathway. I went over the help and training resources. Pointed out several implementation resources. I informed them that it looked like Mansfield was their best user and did cycles quarterly. I pointed out that they weren't creating their snapshots correctly (date range was not sample date range and was only the day they created the snapshot). The other two facilities haven't used in 1-2 years it appears. They expressed it was a lot of information to take in and they'll have to look around some more and come up with a plan. Pam is excited for the QAPI piece. They just re-evaluated their QA process and want to incorporate abaqis into it. They're hoping to migrate their QAPI Plan and FA into abaqis at some point. I did show them the QAPI Plan. They expressed it will take some time to be effective with abaqis.. They needed to take some time to figure out how to implement it in their buildings and getting organized and getting it started. John is planning to get started with PAC since this was requested by the owners. They're planning to talk about abaqis with Coleman tomorrow. I provided them with my contact information. Let them know that they could reach out at any time and that I would reach out in a week or two to see how things are going. Emphasized that we can come up with a training plan for the homes and additional training with them as well. Emphasized the homes that haven't been using will likely need some training. Pam was not a user in abaqis yet, and John expressed that he knew how to add her. All questions answered at the present time. Shortly after we concluded the training, I received a call from John. He was getting Pam in as a user and noticed that quite a few users were no longer with the company and he wanted to know how to disable them. I walked him through how to delete them. Session 2 (2/26/20): Training completed with John Starner and Pam Campbell. The next part of abaqis that they wanted to learn was the QAPI Plan and PIPs, so we discussed those. I went over the Corporate QAPI plan and explained they can make different sections ""read only"". Showed them how to activate the corporate template. I then showed them how the facilities would create their facility level QAPI plans. Showed them how the information comes over from the corporate template and how the ""read only"" function works. We then moved onto PIPs. I showed them an example and then walked through how to create a PIP. Explained the corporate PIPs and facility PIPs. They really didn't have any questions throughout. They already had some identified areas that they were planning to start PIPs on (holes in the MAR/TAR, completing nursing assessments timely). They have some PIPs they're doing on paper and they thought they would transition one of them into abaqis and see how it works. Once they get things figured out they'll branch out and introduce it to the facilities and do education with them. PCC is rolling out right now, so they don't want to overwhelm the staff or themselves. They thought they would be ready in a couple weeks to talk about the mock survey/survey prep function of abaqis. They did not want to schedule anything yet though and said they would let me know when they were ready. I'll reach out in a couple weeks if I don't hear anything."

IS #2 07/09/20 : Attendee - Jayshree Barot (MDS nurse at Crane's Mill) was the only staff that logged in for the webinar. I started with a review of the MDS Indicator report and then we looked at the MDS 3.0 report. Jayshree is part of the QA team but said she feels she does not have a meaningful role. She voiced that she reviews the QM reports so we discussed using the QM data to create a PIP. Their UTI rate for long-term residents is several percentage points above the state and national average, so we used this data and I created a PIP with her permission. Will f/u in a few weeks to see if she has any other questions."

I started out by going over what abaqis is. I used the 3 PPT slides from the Session 1 LOT. We talked about the different features of abaqis. I went through basic navigation with them. We talked about the various reports, meeting mintues, notifications, the help and training resources and manage tab. When reviewing the residents section, there were a few residents on the list that had DC - some quite awhile ago and others recent. I showed them how to manually discharge residents and clean up the resident list. We discussed resident groups and Johnna really liked this feature. She thought it would be great for assignments, as they struggled a bit with that before. I showed them the MDS indicator report. I also went over user management at Johnna's request. She needed to add a new staff member and delete a few. Johnna inquired about the random sample. She didn't want to create a sample but wanted to talk about it, so we did. We discussed how residents are chosen, how many residents to have in the sample, and using resident groups for additional residents. She also wanted to discuss cycles, so we did. I pulled up the QA Cycle worksheet and we discussed how they could make 2x/year work. All questions answered throughout the training. I provided them with my contact information and encouraged them to reach out with any questions and training needs. We did not set up additional training, but I offered reports training and Investigations training and any other training that they would need. Explained that it would be key for us to have an investigations training due to them struggling with it in the past. Johnna said that they did assessments on everyone in the building last time and they had almost every care area trigger forward and they became very overwhelmed that they just stopped using. I explained that I can help them with prioritizing care areas and residents and we can work on that together. Will continue to follow up with Johnna. Session 2 (11/18/19) - We had 6 staff members on the training. These included: Johnna (NHA), Nadine (DON), Kim (Dietary), Jodie (Activities), Melanie (ADON), and Stefany (SSD). We started by discussing reports and how to use them to select their residents for investigation. We discussed the SBCA, MDS, and SBR reports. I pointed out some possible coding errors. Johnna wanted to lock their sample so I walked them through how to do that and I locked their sample for them. I then walked them through how to create a snapshot. I explained the different snapshots and we created their QAPI investigation snapshot. We then discussed how to navigate the snapshot and complete investigations using CE pathways and Guidance to surveyors. We discussed initiating care areas for investigation (hospice, dialysis, etc). We discussed priortizing the care areas and we discussed how many residents to investigate for each area (5 for Un Meds and 3-ish for the remaning areas). We also discussed the facility tasks. There weren't many questions throughout the training, but all questions answered. Johnna thought they would likely have questions as they began to do some of the investigations. We discussed their cycle briefly (2 mo assess; 2 mo investigate; 2 mo corrective action). I mentioned possibly finishing with investigations the rest of the year and then started fresh with a new cycle at the beginning of the year. Johnna thought they would likely stay on their ""funky cycles"", but they would see how things went, as they would likely do corrective action as their doing the investigations. I emphasized that they should not hesitate to reach out if they need anything."
5004V000011UtlRQAS,Corporate Implementation Series 4,"IS #1 09/03/20: Attendees - Carol Crandall, ADON at Cedar Creek. Carol shared that she is new to LTC (previously worked in a hospital) and has only worked at Cedar Creek for a couple months. Carol had trouble logging into the webinar and couldn't see my screen. The training was conducted via phone. Carol had not logged into abaqis and didn't know her password. I sent her a link to reset her password and helped her get logged in. Much of the time was spent on logging in so I focused on their recent QAPI Sample (Q3) and Reports. I guided her through the RI and Summary by Resident reports. She asked about Investigations, so I assisted her with creating their snapshot since their sample was complete. I provided a broad overview of the snapshot and suggested another session with management staff to cover Investigations in more detail. Carol agreed and date options were emailed. IS #2 09/24/20: Attendees - Casey Williams, RDO; Karen Henry, Corp Nurse; Pam Loveless, Corp Nurse MDS; Jeanette Phillips, Corp; Tami Doepke, Corp; Elisha Fade, Corp. Reviewed the corporate QAPI report with corp. staff with focus on the missing sections of PIPs (measures, RCA) and unfinished PIPs. The staff said they would be interested in receiving these reports. Casey mentioned they are starting Mock Surveys so I told them about the Mock Survey workflow in abaqis. Casey asked that I tell Tammy Whorton about it. "

They do not have abaqis user ids. This facility lost their ADON/abaqis Manager 11 months ago and stopped using abaqis. They are now ready to re-engage. An abaqis overview was provided with focus on the QAPI Assessments. Karen generated a new sample. They plan to move to investigations by May 1. Training 2 5/9/19: Attendees - Jim DeLuca    Administrator; Karen Walker    Director of Nursing; Shannon Eichenhofer    Director of Social Work; Morgan (SW Intern). Reviewed RI, SBCA, SBR and MDS reports. Provided overview of Snapshots and created the QAPI snapshot. Reviewed the Nutrition CE pathway and provided overview of Facility Tasks. Assisted them with initiating a PIP based on their reports. Jim wanted to do a PIP on choices since their RI score was only 42%. Assisted them with setting up the PIP and discussed possible Root Causes for low Resident choice scores. Will meet again in 6 weeks to review PIP progress and Investigation report. Training 3 7/22/19 : Attendees - Jim DeLuca -  Administrator; Karen Walker - Director of Nursing; Shannon Eichenhofer - Director of Social Work, Katarina - Social Worker. Reviewed Choice PIP progress and further discussed RCA. Assisted in entering Interventions into PIP and demonstrated how to upload supporting documentation. Jim had questions about how to document what they had done to address the concerns brought up by individual Residents. I told him he could edit the RI and add a comment in capital letters stating how they addressed the concern. I also showed him the QAPI Immediate Action Plan. We discussed how he could summarize their immediate actions in the Meeting Notes section of the PIP. While we were talking about meeting notes I took the opportunity to show him our Meeting Notes feature in abaqis. Jim said they are in their survey window and were planning to start a new cycle of abaqis in the next several weeks. I noted they did not complete any Investigations or Facility Tasks and suggested the do the Facility Tasks first and then start their new sample. Jim like that idea since their survey cycle just opened. Reviewed Help and Training Resources again.  "
5004V000011UtlTQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (4/18/19) - Overview training completed on 4/18/19. There were 6 staff present including Margaret, Gerry (Nurse manager), David (Nurse manager), Odessa (Nurse manager), and Grace (shift coordinator). They said that they had all used abaqis before - none were new to the program so they didn't want a lot of specifics, just a general overview. They hadn't used the program in over a year, so wanted to discuss the new parts of the program. We discussed login in/users. Most had forgot. I explained how to request a password reset. Prior to training, I noticed MDS hadn't been uploaded since 1/8/19. I walked through how to upload MDS and explained that needs to be their first step with getting back on track. I then went through the manage tab and what could be found under it and I walked them through creating a sample. We discussed their sample size. They will likely do around 40 C and 10 A. They did not want to discuss assessments as they knew how to do those. I emphasized the importance of comments for negative responses. We then discussed reports and started with SBCA. Explained how to interpret, etc. They were lacking comments from the last sample, so I again emphasized the importance of comments. We then discussed the MDS report, how to interpret it, and how to use it. I then finished with a brief overview of snapshots and investigations. I showed them how to create a snapshot and then we went into the snapshot and showed them how to navigate it. They are hoping to get started with a new sample next week. They will spend today and tomorrow uploading MDS. They requested my assistance again down the line. They said they never had a problem with completing assessments, but they were never able to make it to the second step. I explained that additional training for the snapshot and investigations would be crucial with helping them succeed. They thought they would take 30 days to complete the sample. They were a very interactive group. All questions answered. Session 2 (5/30/19) - Training completed on 5/30/19. There were 3 staff present including Margaret, David, and their new PCC, Caroline. Odessa was off today. Margaret made it seem like she hadn't really checked the progress of the sample or anything. They had not run any reports. We looked at their progress and they had completed 21 out of 30 residents. Margaret said their last survey was in September and they've heard that the state is ahead a couple months, so they want to be survey ready. Explained how the assessments and the investigations/corrective action help them to be survey ready. We went on to discuss the reports. We started out by discussing the SBCA report. Explained how to use it for investigations. We then discussed the MDS report. They really liked that report and thought that would be the main report they would use to prepare for survey. We then discussed the Summary by Resident report. Showed them how to filter by sample or by date range. This was another report that they liked so they could see the residents that flagged for multiple things. We then went on to create their QAPI Snapshot. I explained how to navigate the snapshot and complete the investigation using CE Pathways. We discussed the Unnecessary Medications pathway. They didn't seem too interested in actually using the snapshot or pathways, as it seemed they just wanted to use the reports to do their own investigations, so I didn't explain much more. I did explain using the pathways as a guide and answering the Ftag questions as a place to document what they found. I explained the importance of completing the Facility Tasks, due to a lot of citations coming from those. They seemed to understand. I briefly showed them the Ftag investigation report and showed them they can compare each snapshot and see that they're improving with their Ftags and see how many Ftags they cite themselves. I asked if they were familiar with our PIPs, and they were not. I then explained the PIPs and went through the example and went over how to create a PIP. They really liked that function. Margaret did express that the session had a lot of information to take in and process. They are wanting another training after the 4th of July, so we can review what they've done so far and provide feedback. That way they will be ready for survey if it does come early. Will reach out mid-June to get that scheduled. Session 3 (2/11/20): Training completed with 3 staff members including Jojo, David, and Tiana. I first discussed the new dashboard and it's features and how to navigate it. Jojo did not have an abaqis login so I discussed user management. I explained that David only had the permission to add/edit users, so he would need to get Jojo access. I went through how to add users, change permissions, and delete users. I discussed the MDS Indicator Rates report, as this was a new report to them. We created a new QAPI sample. They decided on 25C and 30A and they would take a couple months to do it. Jojo mentioned them having about 5 staff that would help with assessments, so that would be 5 residents each and the AR was very easy. Jojo asked if any of the assessments/questions had changed. I informed her that they hadn't and I emphasized the importance of comments. Jojo said they do not have laptops to use, so she was going to have to print the assessments and transcribe them into abaqis. Jojo mentioned it would be much better if they had iPads/tablets. Jojo asked how to run reports, so I showed her and we discussed the SBCA and MDS reports. She was slightly confused by the SBCA and she thought most of the information came from MDS, but I educated her and I believe she understood. She mentioned doing the assessments for a couple of months and then creating a new sample. I asked whether she did snapshots/investigations before at her other facility and she didn't seem to know what I meant and said she mainly did abaqis herself at the other facility. I took them to the snapshots and we discussed what it was and how to navigate it. I then walked them through how to do an investigation using the CE Pathway and we walked through Un Meds. Their goal was to do 3 cycles of abaqis. Jojo thought they would work on the sample for a month or so and then reach out for more training. A few questions throughout. Jojo was very engaged. All questions answered."
5004V000011UtlUQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS LOT #1 4/4/19:  Attendees: Ana Montagni, Assistant Administrator; Pam Mendoza, Director of Recreation;  Ariana Galitsis, Social Worker; Aurora Rabago, Director of Nursing; Anne Gonzalez, Unit Manager;  Laura Claeys, Unit Manager. This was mostly a Q&A session. Ana said they are talking about abaqis at their weekly meetings. I assisted her with generating a Q2 QAPI Sample of 20/10. They had a few questions about the Snapshot and how the areas are prioritized by abaqis.  IS LOT #2 4/22/19: Attendees - Ana Montagni    Assistant Administrator; Ariana Galitsis    Social Worker; Laura Claeys    Unit Manager; Pam Mendoza    Director of Recreation; Rowena Sebastian    Regional Clinical Specialist. This LOT was initially set up to review reports and investigations however, Ana said they are expecting survey any day now and they don't have a completed QAPI Plan or FA. Rowena gave permission to activate the Corporate template. I walked them through the plan and clarified the definition of QAPI plan (they call an action plan/PIP a QAPI plan). I also reviewed the progress they made in the FA and provided additional suggestions. Next, I showed them the PIP and explained the required sections. Ana said she felt overwhelmed and intimated that the DON is not helping with the FA and Ana does not have a clinical background. I told her she will need to have the DON or a clinical management staff assist with the FA.  IS LOT #3 6/10/19: Attendees - Ana Montagni, Assistant Administrator. Reviewed QAPI and Investigation Reports and discussed how to use them in QA. Noted missing comments and talked about the value of having comments. Walked Ana through creating their Q2 Snaphot and discussed prioritizing care areas and using reports for resident investigation selection. Briefly reviewed Facility Tasks. Ana requested authority to add Users and I told her she already had that capabiity. Lastly, discussed how to use the Investigation Reports for determining QAPI Immediate Action Plans vs. PIPs. "
5004V000011UtlVQAS,Implementation Series 1,"Session 1 (1/3/20): abaqis Overview completed with Amy (QAPI Coordinator) and the new DON, Michele Cone. This training was primarily for Michele because she didn't know anything about abaqis. Amy wanted to listen in to refresh her memory and see if she picked up on anything new. I first discussed the different features and components of abaqis. We then went over basic navigation - went through the classic dashboard first and then at the end of the training I showed them how to get to different areas using the new dashboard. We discussed samples and we went ahead and created a sample. Did 20 for a census sample and 10 for an admission sample. Their MDS files were not up to date. Amy expressed they have had some MDS turnover, so they will work on getting everything uploaded. I showed them how to get to the assessments and how to start them. Amy was struggling a bit to find the FA with the new dashboard. I went through how to find it, edit it and print it. I also went over how to create a new one, and we created a new one on the training. Amy also couldn't firgure out how to delete users, so I showed her how to do this. We discussed frequency and the different options. They did not decide on anything yet though. This was a very interactive training and they appreciated all of the information. Amy expressed that it was very helpful for her. All questions were answered.  The plan: They will work on getting the MDS up to date. Once that is done, they will reach out to me to get another training scheduled with all of the staff. Amy said none of the staff will remember how to do anything. The plan will be to do an overview and discuss assessments. Session 2 (1/29/20): Training completed with approximately 7 staff members, including Amy. I did not catch all of their names. We did an overview and discussed assessments. I started out by explaining what abaqis was. We then did some basic navigation - navigating the new dashboard and the classic dashboard. Went over the help and training resources. We then discussed all 6 QAPI assessments, emphasizing the importance of comments. I then reviewed the SBCA report. There were no questions throughout and they were pretty quite. Amy said she would work on assigning the assessments and then they would get started right away Session 3 (3/4/20):  Training was completed with 9 staff members. These included Amy, Michele (DON), Jeanne (Dietician), Donna (SW), Alyssa (SW), Michelle (SSD), Rhonda (Dir of Res Service), Lorraine (ADON), and Gwen (Life Enrichment). This was an investigations training. I started out by going over the SBCA and MDS reports and explained how to utilize those to pick the residents to investigate. Some didn't have comments, so I explained how to 'view' the completed assessments. They expressed understanding of the reports. I then showed them how to lock the sample and we locked it. I then walked them through creating the snapshot and explained the different snapshot types. I explained how to navigate the snapshot and then explained how to complete an investigation. We discussed the Unecessary Med pathway. Explained how to use the pathway and then answer the Ftag questions in abaqis. I then went to choices and explained the guidance to surveyors. The choices investigation still doesn't have the 'show details' button. I then explained the facility level tasks (personal funds and environment). I then briefly explained the facility tasks tab. I then took them to the help and training resources link and took them to all the CE Pathways. They were very overwhelmed. Amy said they thought the assessments were overwhelming, but now these were even more overwhelming. I tried to ease their stress by explaining they didn't have to complete all areas and how to prioritize the care areas. I explained they could use as much or as little of the pathways as they wanted to. The most important thing was to do correct acion and fix the concerns of the residents and make sure it's no more of a system issue. I explained they'd want to divy up the workload (ex: activities can do activities, dietician can do nutrition, etc). I'm not sure it helped to ease their stress, but Amy said she woulld reach out if they had any questions along the way. Not many questions throughout, but all were answered. I will reach out after next week to see how things are going, if I don't hear from Amy sooner."
5004V000011UtlWQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 1/17/20 : Attendee - Karen Zick (DON). Reviewed the new dashboard and assisted Karen with closing old Facility Assessments and reactivating current Facility Assessment. Also reviewed how to print the FA. Karen was having difficulty with getting the Print for Survey OFF and ON button. She said it would not switch to ON. She also was getting a message ""abaqis not responding due to long running script."" Will notify CS via RIS. IS #2 07/20/20: Karen requested a call to have a Q & A and to let me know she is retiring at the end of this month. Maggie Urtx will be the new Director of Clinical Services - Skilled. During the call I answered Karen's questions about the QAPI Sample and told her about new features.Specifically, I reviewed QAPI Sample feature to exclude previously selected residents as Karen said the Family's complained about being interviewed every month (they have 44 skilled beds). I also walked her through accessing and editing the Facility Assessment and recommended adding COVID-19 to various sections. Also, suggested they upload any COVID-19 P & P. Lastly, I reviewed the ""Print for Survey"" button option. Karen had some questions about QAPI Accreditation. I let her know the new name is QAPI Distinction and told her I would forward her questions to our Client Support Dept. (see case notes). Additionally, I told Karen I would send her the pdf of the new QAPI Distinction requirements. IS #3 09/04/20: Attendee - Maggie Urtz, Director of Clinical for Skilled Care. Reviewed the FA that was started by the previous DON and made suggestions for improvements. Demonstrated how to access the FA, add participants, edit, and upload. Also covered the COVID-19 Self-Assessment. Maggie asked about the new survey and I told her it would be in abaqis by the end of Sept. Maggie requested help with correcting her name - spelled Urtx in abaqis, s/b Urtz. Also requested help with starting a new sample but not until Q4 - task set."
5004V000011UtlXQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 1,"IS #1 5/20/19: Attendees - Craig Kelley, Administrator (hired 4 months ago). I had a scheduled call with Craig to gather preliminary information and set-up training but the call turned into a training session. Craig logged into abaqis and I guided him through the FA, QAPI Plan and PIPs. I assisted him with printing the FA and QAPI Plan and suggested he review them with his team since these documents were developed by the previous Administrator and DON. I walked Craig through the PIP template using an example he provided to set up the Definition and Team members. I showed him the Help and Training Resources link and told him how to ask for the abaqis training platform. Craig asked that I send him some time slots for T,W or TH in the afternoon to set up a training with himself, the new DON and the new MDS coordinator.  IS #2 8/15/19: Attendees - Terry Wilkerson (Corp Nurse), Traci Carr (Corp Nurse), Keziah Koshegee (QA nurse). Reviewed User Management and walked them through deleting ex-DON. Keziah will be the abaqis manager but hasn't used abaqis for a long time. I assisted Traci with locking and generating a new sample and reviewed the residents to make sure they were all current. I briefly showed them the RI and FI as time did not allow more detail. Keziah plans to have the DON Suzie McCaskill (DON) do the SI, RO, CRR, and AR, and Maura Gail (Activities) do the RI and FI but neither attended the training today. Request they have access to training platform. QAPI Reports and PIPs webinar scheduled for 9/11/19 at 10AM CT. IS #3 9/11/19: Attendees - Karen Duncan (RN Consultant) Terry Wilkerson (Corp Nurse/Acting Admin at Pauls Valley), Traci Carr (Corp Nurse), Keziah Koshegee (QA nurse/AIM). We discussed their QAPI cycle since they did not do any work on their Sample. Per Keziah, they identified who would be doing the QAPI assessments but they don't plan to start a sample until October 1. I reviewed how to generate a sample and will also send them a reminder on 10/1 with a copy of the Getting Started with Samples help doc. Next we reviewed and updated their QAPI Plan. I suggested they print the draft and share it with the Med Dir and other QA staff. Lastly, we reviewed the PIP template. They did not have a PIP topic but Traci Carr recommended they review their QA meeting notes and pick a QM to do a PIP. I also reviewed Help and Training Resources, including how to access the regulations/appendix PP."
5004V000011UtlYQAS,abaqis Implementation Series 2,"IS #1 1/29/20: Attendee- Ann Hope (MDS Nurse) This training was done on the telephone with Ann logged into abaqis. Reviewed the Resident List with Ann per her email request because many d/c'd residents were showing up in their sample. They have not been consistent with uploading MDS files in the past. I explained that the resident list is kept up to date based on MDS files being uploaded. I talked Ann through manually discharging residents. Ann also wanted information on training resources for her staff. In addition to offering online training, I instructed Ann to click on the Question Mark in the right upper corner of the dashboard to access Help and Training docs and videos. I also suggested that her staff request access to the training platform. Ann has access but never activated her account. Next, I talked Ann through creating the Facility Assessment and adding Participants, and walked her through the first 2 sections. Will send f/u email with Resident Management and Facility Assessment help documents. IS #2 03/04/20: Attendees - Ann Hope (MDS Nurse), Veronica Onwunaka (Administrator) Carl Heron (Assistant DON), OTHER STAFF ALSO ATTENDED BUT DID NOT GET THEIR NAMES. I ASKED ANN TO EMAIL A LIST OF ATTENDEES. Reviewed the Facility Assessment and assisted them in identifying the staff who should be involved in completing each section. They determined that CNAs and Therapists would complete all the sections on Function; Admissions and Nursing would complete all the sections on Acuity; Social Services would complete the Cognitive section; and Dietary, Activities and Social Services would complete all the Cultural sections. During the webinar i provided examples for each section and reviewed the Resources tab, specifically covering the Staffing Worksheet. Also reminded them to include Infection in their All Hazards Risk Assessment. They were engaged and asked questions throughout. Will follow up on their progress in 4 weeks. IS #3 07/01/20 : Attendees - Ann Hope (MDS Nurse), Carl Heron (ADON/Infection Preventionist). Assisted Carl and Ann with setting up several COVID-19 Self-Assessments for each Unit. They plan to complete a self-assessment every month on every unit during the 3rd Quarter. They do not have any current positive covid-19 cases, but they were hit hard in the last couple months and lost 50 residents and 2 staff members to the infection. Their goal is to stay covid-free and they will be using the self-assessment to regularly audit their units for infection compliance. The Resource and References list was reviewed, too. I encouraged Carl to call me with any questions and offered to assist them with setting up a PIP on preventing covid community spread. Will f/u with Ann and Carl on PIP training."

Primarily reviewed the QAPI Tools. Showed them how to create a new Self-Assessment. Per Chris, they did a Self-Assessment in 2017 but I could not find it (even after I x'd out ""active""). I will ask CS to review. Per Chris they are primarily using abaqis for the QAPI tools. I reviewed PIPs in detail. They current use paper to record PIPs. Chris said they had a meeting yesterday to talk about how they can more fully utilize abaqis and decided to create a snapshot every month to see what is triggering based on MDS metrics. I reminded Chris that the QAPI assessments would also be pulled into the QAPI snapshot if they were to complete them. I reviewed how to create a QAPI Sample. They did not have any further questions and did not think they needed add'l training. I showed them the Help and Training Resources link and reviewed the tabs, including, Online Training. IS #2 4/14/20 : Attendee - Marisa Parker, Administrator. Marisa is the new administrator and is new to abaqis. Reviewed the FA, QAPI Plan, QAPI Sample, QA Meeting notes, Help, and Users. She will be attending the COVID-19 stand-up webinar on Thursday so I also walked her through creating the COVID-19 Survey Workflow. She agreed to do a CNR interview with me so I can formulate a training and implementation plan for them. CNR scheduled for Friday at 1:30 CT. Add'l training and Implementation will be determined after the interview. IS #3 06/04/20 : Attendees - Marisa Parker, Administrator; Carol Tucek, DON; Angelita Moreno; Kendria Robinson, SW; Tim Tatom, MDS; Shanna Doescher, ADON; Becky Tatom, Activities. Marissa asked for a quick refresher on getting started with their QAPI Sample. With Marisa permission, I locked their incomplete open sample and created a new one. Marisa said she would be the abaqis Queen and make assignments and monitor completion. I did a brief review of the assessments and reminded them to put in comments. I also showed them one of their older Resident Interview Reports and reminded them to look at the reports as they collect data.   "

I originally trained this facility back in 2011 and there were challenges at that time. Helen informed me that they didn't have the staff resources to pull everyone into the training today. Therefore, she plans to choose the abaqis Team Members and use the videos to train the staff. They have computers, but will be completing the assessments on paper and she will have the staff input their own assessments. Cindy has already cleaned up the resident list. She will upload the MDSs from the past few weeks (last upload was beginning of Sept at the time of the training). In the next 2 weeks, they will have identified and trained the team. Session 2 will probably be 5-6 weeks from now. "
